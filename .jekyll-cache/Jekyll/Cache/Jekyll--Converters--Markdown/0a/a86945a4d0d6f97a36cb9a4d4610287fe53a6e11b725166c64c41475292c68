<p>Did not take the Vitamin D supplement today or the multivitamin. Though I <em>did</em> go for a two-mile walk outside earlier, this was rather close to sunset. Given that it’s the dead of winter and given that I haven’t eaten any foods containing Vitamin D recently (to my knowledge), I’m likely pretty damn low in the stuff right now. Some observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When looking at my phone’s lock screen photo<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fn1">1</a></sup>, I immediately began to think of the depicted mountain range as a 3D object, if that makes sense. That is, I immediately intuited that the image was facing south and that the mountain on the left side of the image depicted the east-most part of the range. My brain (God I hate using that phrase, but it feels appropriate here) then superimposed over the mountains the trail that I followed when hiking them. At various points of interest along the trail – these visible in the image – I involuntarily recalled what the views were like from those points. There was something immensely satisfying about this all playing out so efficiently – in the span of less than a second. Though I’ve long had difficulty locating the right permutation of words to communicate this sensation, the <a href="https://www.stim.blog/random/">Random Walks</a> essay gets at it with: “I just want to… imagine where I am in relation to everything else.”</li>
  <li>To be clear, this doesn’t usually happen. Generally, the lock screen photo is thought of more for what is represents; rather than being a specific mountain range with an information-dense, spatially aware encoding, it is a low-information pointer to the concept of “a mountain range” and to all the cultural connotations that go with that.</li>
  <li>I am reminded of that sentence at the end of Random Walks: “The key is to stop viewing objects as referents to non-sensory thoughts.” Now, at the end of that essay I hinted at a return to the subject and an invocation of the hippocampus. As the state being described right now recalls that described in the first half of <a href="https://www.stim.blog/photos/">How Does One Sort a Box of Old Photos?</a>, and as that latter essay makes explicit reference to the hippocampus, I may finally make good on that promise.</li>
  <li>I felt an immense urge about two hours ago to look over the iPhone Calendar app and scroll all the way from my birth to today. This is a thing I will do from time to time, the idea being to free-associate memories as the months and years roll by. In a really good session of this, things I hardly ever think about are involuntarily recalled and I “learn” something about myself.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="fn2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>As a general matter, I get the feeling my ability to effectively free-associate these memories has declined over time. Tonight, however, the session went really well. Granted, I didn’t get all the way through my life (and in fact skipped around a bit; I have work tomorrow), I can state that the highly nonverbal “vibes” of the years of my life are alive and well, resting in my brain (<em>shudders</em>, there is it again…) as mountain-range-like, awe-inspiring objects that can viewed from any one of a very large number of angles.</li>
  <li>So there we have the connection between spatial thinking and the effortless association of personal memories. Given that a part of the brain known as the hippocampus is involved in both of these activities (a fact I picked up in PSY 14 back in the Fall 2020 semester, shout-out to Liz Phelps and Dan Schacter<sup><a href="#fn33" id="fn3">3</a></sup>), I’m inclined to think something about my behavior today diverted blood flow to that region.</li>
</ul>

  <a href="#fn2">2.</a> Though I do recall having free-associated into existence a memory tonight that made me think “holy crap, I haven’t thought about that in forever,” I cannot, at this moment, recall what that memory was. The little rascal seems to have gotten away, perhaps not to be fished up again for another thirty years.

  <a href="#fn3">3.</a> This closeness isn’t too much of a surprise. A few hours ago, simulating for my own amusement how a run-of-the-mill interaction with my mother’s boyfriend this evening could have played out in a more interesting and highly self-aggrandizing way,<sup><a href="#fnaa" id="fna">a</a></sup> I challenged myself to think of as many things that happened in 2017 as I could while talking to myself in the bathroom mirror.<sup><a href="#fnbb" id="fnb">b</a></sup>

  <a href="#fna">a.</a> B is her boyfriend, D is me. This is the simulated conversation. In reality he just looked at the Star Wars photo<sup><a href="#fnii" id="fni">i</a></sup> and thought it was funny.
<br /><br />
D: Yeah, this is one of the things I’m taking out of my room and bringing to the apartment. It comes from November 2010 – the third and greatest of the seven Disney trips.
<br /><br />
B: Hah, you even remember the year!
<br /><br />
D: Yup. If you were to graph the quality of the Disney trips over time you would have – [<i>visually depicts graph, egocentrically failing to account for the fact that B is facing D and that the image needs to be reversed</i>]
<br /><br />
B: Wow, Danny. You’re so smart!
<br /><br />
D: I’m an historian of the self. You say a year and I can immediately begin rattling off things that happened in that year.
<br /><br />
B: Uhhhh, how about 2017?
<br /><br />
D: [<i>UNLOADS</i>]
