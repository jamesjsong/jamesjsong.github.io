<p>Unlike those two â€œIntimationsâ€ submissions from earlier in the year <a href="https://www.stim.blog/intimations/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.stim.blog/authenticity/">here</a>, this one actually builds to a concrete, falsifiable hypothesis. Left unsaid is the context of my job. As a call center agent working for a welfare program, I found that my implicit judgment of callers would vary with whether I had taken a Vitamin D supplement in the morning.</p>

<p>Note that the following scan is of a verbatim re-write of what I had initially penned on 7/16/2023; the original is littered with scribbles and is close to illegible.</p>
