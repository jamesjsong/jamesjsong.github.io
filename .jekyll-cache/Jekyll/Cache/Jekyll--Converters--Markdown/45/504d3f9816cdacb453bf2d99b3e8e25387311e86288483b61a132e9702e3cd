<p>With the exception of â€œPresidents Godfather Tier List â€“ Part IIâ€ and the tail-end of â€œLearning, Populism, and Reddit,â€ the following six submissions of mine were written quite some time ago and were recently recovered from a laptop that had crashed. Special thanks to Zach from Eyemax Computer Geeks for helping me get the documents back. That $200 went a long way.</p>

<p>Time appears to have thawed out whatever perfectionistic impulses had kept these documents hidden. While they are by no means everything Iâ€™ve been sitting on, Iâ€™d consider them to be the most complete. Enjoy, fellas.</p>
