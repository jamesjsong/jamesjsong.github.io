Daniel LaPointe

You’re forced to live in a random house in the countryside. In this house you are given access to all the standard amenities (food, water, heat, etc.). You are also given time to exercise in the woods out back as desired, and you may allow temporary visitors so long as certain topics of conversation (to be explained shortly) are avoided. Critically, you are not allowed internet access, and you can have no books in the home written after the year 1665.

Upon entering this cottage, you are told the following:

“Welcome. We hope you can make yourself comfortable. If you would like to return to your normal life, you need only solve the following math problem.

“A man by the name of Johannes Kepler, using data delivered to him from the astronomer Tycho Brahe, has posited the following “Laws of Planetary Motion”:

1.	The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci
2.	A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time
3.	The square of a planet’s orbital period is proportional to the cube of the length of the semi-major axis of its orbit

“Your task is to formulate a single law of planetary motion from which these three laws can be mathematically derived. If you have any questions about the meaning of the above statements, we will be glad to provide you with a teacher. This teacher, however, will only be able to catch you up on the state of mathematical and scientific knowledge as it existed in the year 1665. Finally, we will see to it that you never run out of pencils or paper.”

Question: If given enough time, would you be able to free yourself from the cottage by independently deducing Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation?

Perhaps it would take you many years longer than it took Newton to solve the problem – but if you answered “yes” to the above question, then you believe in objectivity. As a corollary to this belief, you deny the centrality of personality as a driver of history. “Isaac Newton,” to you, is merely a string of syllables describing the first brain to solve a problem that was going to be solved anyway. Wind back the clocks, give civilization another run, and the base unit of force is called a “tashigi,” or a “johnson,” or a “mukele.”

Apply this line of thinking to the question of politics and you end up, more or less, with the “liberal agenda” that’s being “pushed” onto college students. Statements like “minorities are often scapegoated when the economy goes awry” are not Jewish plots to undermine Christian hegemony. They are objective statements that would be deduced by *any* society that’s been around long enough to gather the requisite data. Think of it like this. If the US is genuinely on the verge of collapse (as you propose), and the next few centuries are not unlike the Dark Ages that followed the fall of Rome, then whatever advanced society emerges from the rubble is going to deduce a law similar to the one above. That is, they will eventually notice that minority groups have a tendency to be blamed for things that aren’t their fault. This is a straightforward consequence of the human desire for narrative simplicity and to prefer those who resemble them.

To acknowledge this requires humility and self-awareness. When you, Nick, find in the Jewish people a comically simple villainy explaining *everything* that’s wrong in the world, have you ever stopped to wonder, “Hey, maybe I’m falling prey to this general tendency humans have to draw up convenient narratives”? When you view Hitler as a singular force in human history who “cast a long shadow over the 20th Century,” have you ever considered him as merely one instantiation of a more general phenomenon of tribalist scapegoating? How about when you fancy *yourself* a nascent Great Man of history? Have you ever considered that the entity known as “Nicholas Fuentes” is simply a brain under the influence of narcissistic personality disorder?

From one 24-year-old to another, I can say that this line of thinking is incredibly demoralizing. Pop your balloon of an ego and you feel like you’ve forfeited your spot in the history books. But it’s the only choice you have if you take the truth even remotely seriously.
