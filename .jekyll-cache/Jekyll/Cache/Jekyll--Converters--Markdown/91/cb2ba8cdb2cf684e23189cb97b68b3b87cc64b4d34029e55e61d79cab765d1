I"â<p>Daniel LaPointe</p>

<p>Did not take the Vitamin D supplement today or the multivitamin. Though I <em>did</em> go for a two-mile walk outside earlier, this was rather close to sunset. Given that it‚Äôs the dead of winter and given that I haven‚Äôt eaten any foods containing Vitamin D recently (to my knowledge), I‚Äôm likely pretty damn low in the stuff right now. Some observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When looking at my phone‚Äôs lock screen photo<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fn1">1</a></sup>, I immediately began to think of the depicted mountain range as a 3D object, if that makes sense. That is, I immediately intuited that the image was facing south and that the mountain on the left side of the image depicted the east-most part of the range. My brain (God I hate using that phrase, but it feels appropriate here) then superimposed over the mountains the trail that I followed when hiking them. At various points of interest along the trail ‚Äì these visible in the image ‚Äì I involuntarily recalled what the views were like from those points. There was something immensely satisfying about this all playing out so efficiently ‚Äì in the span of less than a second. Though I‚Äôve long had difficulty locating the right permutation of words to communicate this sensation, the <a href="https://www.stim.blog/random/">Random Walks</a> essay gets at it with: ‚ÄúI just want to‚Ä¶ imagine where I am in relation to everything else.‚Äù</li>
  <li>To be clear, this doesn‚Äôt usually happen. Generally, the lock screen photo is thought of more for what is represents; rather than being a specific mountain range with an information-dense, spatially aware encoding, it is a low-information pointer to the concept of ‚Äúa mountain range‚Äù and to all the cultural connotations that go with that.</li>
  <li>I am reminded of that sentence at the end of Random Walks: ‚ÄúThe key is to stop viewing objects as referents to non-sensory thoughts.‚Äù Now, at the end of that essay I hinted at a return to the subject and an invocation of the hippocampus. As the state being described right now recalls that described in the first half of <a href="https://www.stim.blog/photos/">How Does One Sort a Box of Old Photos?</a>, and as that latter essay makes explicit reference to the hippocampus, I may finally make good on that promise.</li>
  <li>I felt an immense urge about two hours ago to look over the iPhone Calendar app and scroll all the way from my birth to today. This is a thing I will do from time to time, the idea being to free-associate memories as the months and years roll by. In a really good session of this, things I hardly ever think about are involuntarily recalled and I ‚Äúlearn‚Äù something about myself.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fn2">2</a></sup></li>

  <a href="#fn2">2.</a> Though I do recall having free-associated into existence a memory tonight that made me think ‚Äúholy crap, I haven‚Äôt thought about that in forever,‚Äù I cannot, at this moment, recall what that memory was. The little rascal seems to have gotten away, perhaps not to be fished up again for another thirty years.
