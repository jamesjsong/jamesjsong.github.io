<p><em>[Author’s Note: Like “Journal Session With Low Vitamin D: In Which…”, this piece has footnotes that take some time to navigate, especially if one watches all of the linked videos. Though the reader is of course free to do as they choose, my recommendation is to: do a sweep through the main piece; then read the first six footnotes and associated sub-footnotes (i.e., the footnotes for the main piece), watching the videos as they come up; then read the “Note on Influences” in tandem with those footnotes in the usual way (i.e., reading each footnote the moment it is first encountered rather than waiting).]</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Having finished two summer courses last week, I’ve been given roughly three weeks of downtime until the onset of the fall semester. As I was just approved for on-campus housing, the primary anticipated stressor for this period (hunting for an apartment in Cambridge) has vanished, and I’m left with little to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the past few days I’ve been sifting through a Google Drive that contains documents from throughout my life. As I’m something of a hoarder in both the physical and digital sense, this drive contains things like: a scan of “My Writing Journal Book 3” from first grade; a 23-slide PowerPoint titled “Battle Strategies” made in 2009 detailing what I believed to be optimal tactics for winning a protracted fifth-grade snowball war; a 55-page-long (!) screenplay written on my spare time in eighth grade for a movie that never got made titled <em>Night with the Pembletons</em>; 22 scanned pages of journalling from 2014 in which it is made very clear that David Foster Wallace’s “This is Water” speech had an impact on 16-year-old me; an abandoned r/circlejerk post from 2021 in which I spoofed a “feels kinda racist” Reddit cliche that heavy metal fans are more well-behaved than rap fans, a cliche parroted all over the place in the wake of the AstroWorld crowd crush; etc..<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fn1">1</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there’s a lot of stuff on the Drive – in fact, pretty much everything I can get on there, including old homework assignments.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="fn2">2</a></sup> The result is a panoply of self-contained universes – works of art that set up and just as quickly take down internally consistent ways of knowing the world. Looking over this chaotic heap, I am reminded of Walt Whitman’s line that we “contain multitudes.”<sup><a href="#fn33" id="fn3">3</a></sup> That is, I have grown somewhat “postmodern” about the self in that I have little hope I will ever believe a narrative threaded through these disparate elements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, are there at least some life narratives I find myself falling back on? Sure. A classic one is “the birth of the cognitively modern self,” in which the grandiose mysticism of 2012 gives way to a grounded Enlightenment rationalism in the spring of 2013, the dividing line being my decision to eat KFC instead of pizza on Good Friday when at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum’s food court.<sup><a href="#fn44" id="fn4">4</a></sup> Another narrative treats a trip to Disney World as “the swan song of childhood” – the onset of puberty, the passing of my grandmother, and my first taking the SAT (in seventh grade…<sup><a href="#fn55" id="fn5">5</a></sup>) happening in fairly rapid succession after that. Then you’ve got a more recent narrative that 2022 was a “nuclear winter” following a mess at Harvard – a dismal period that saw a true embracing of personal responsibility on the tail-end, and a newfound suspicion of the field of psychology as a whole.<sup><a href="#fn66" id="fn6">6</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I’m starting to become tired of narratives like this. Instead of solipsistic coming-of-age stories, what I really want are stories focused on others. I want something with <em>depth</em> to it, you know? Perhaps this is what marriage and children provide – a flesh-and-blood grounding in the world and an inherent stakes to everything that renders all that comes before mere shadows upon the wall of the cave.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This isn’t the first time I’ve come to associate document sorting with the thought of children. In fact, I reckon my future children (should they ever come to exist) are the intended beneficiaries of this act of sorting. How surreal would it be to know, as a child, exactly what your parents were up to when they were your age – to be able to quickly determine what they looked like and what they sounded like and what they thought at the drop of a hat? Though it may sound a smidgen obsessive for a parent to construct such an archive – and though a good many children wouldn’t find such an archive to be particularly interesting – it wouldn’t surprise me if this sort of thing starts to become more common with time. That is, we are reaching a point where the Hyper-Documented are starting to have kids with one another. The result, assuming the records have been meticulously enough maintained, will be sort of like one of those race-against-your-ghost things in Mario Kart. “Hold on. 13 years and 8 months… did Dad have a deeper voice by this point?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So maybe I don’t need to worry about overarching narratives. Just working out the chronology and getting everything on the Drive<sup><a href="#fn77" id="fn7">7</a></sup> should be good enough.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the audience pick out the patterns.
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note on Influences</b>: In a prior entry, I called this section the “Influences Disclaimer,” as if to distance myself from what I had written. But that is not the goal here. I’m just genuinely interested in if there’s some sort of connection between diet, sleep, and whatnot and the sort of written work I produce.<sup><a href="#fn88" id="fn8">8</a></sup> Here we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Excellent sleep the night before writing the above, 8 hours and 40 minutes per the records (yes, I do sleep tracking, and I have for quite a while now…), this following a string of three nights averaging 8 hours and 35 minutes. So very good sleep on the whole (not a surprise, with the lack of obligations this week).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sleep went from roughly 4:00 AM to roughly 12:40 PM, consistent with a night owl pattern of mine. Very good blackout curtains (complete with a scheme involving duct-taping the curtains to the wall to block ALL light) make this possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lunch was a turkey and cheese sandwich with lettuce. Pretzels on the side with chocolate oat milk to drink. Eaten shortly after waking. Took a men’s gummy multivitamin with this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exercise included a 3-mile walk in the local Pine Bush Preserve starting at around 6:30 PM in overcast weather. Stopped for a half-hour-long chat on the phone with my father partway through the walk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some degree of pre-occupation with my cousin’s website. The guy is four years older than me, I haven’t interacted with him too much in my life, and I just now learn he’s got: an album on Apple Music, several publications in left-wing media outlets, and an appearance on Sam Seder’s podcast. I listened to his album in a bit of a “holy shit” moment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dinner was salmon with asparagus and microwaved Uncle Ben’s long grain and wild rice. Regular milk (Lactaid brand for my stomach) to drink. Composition of the above (and below?) last night was punctuated by asparagus-smelling piss breaks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snacked on Pepperidge Farm Pirouettes<sup><a href="#fn99" id="fn9">9</a></sup> throughout the day, a source of sugar and a likely source of small amounts of caffeine via the chocolate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Got some feedback from a friend of mine about some video game-style music I had written/performed and shared with him.<sup><a href="#fn1010" id="fn10">10</a></sup></p>

An alternative explanation is that overly serious, aggressively diurnal, “isn’t existence just so <em>fucking</em> awesome”-type commercials have by all means been alive and well, and that I only paid attention to this one in 2014 because we had watched <em>Dead Poets Society</em> in English class that year.

For those not in the know, “don’t eat meat on Good Friday” is a Catholic thing. So opting for the KFC instead of the cheese pizza – in a building that serves as a testament to mankind’s ingenuity and his literal foray into the heavens, no less – amounted to a rejection of God.

<p>The other day, I went through and reread every single one of my submissions to this blog. In so doing, I was on the lookout for the post that left me with the best feeling. That is, I wanted to locate the post that had the best “vibe” to it. Somewhat to my surprise, this ended up being “Notes from the Fourth Floor of the American Museum of Natural History” – a post that has received little reference in other posts and that thematically sticks out like a sore thumb when compared with the rest of my submissions.</p>

<p>More so than any other submission, “Notes from the Fourth Floor of the American Museum of Natural History” manages to break free from the fixation on the self. It also manages to reflect an embodied experience. Put another way, it is not the sort of thing that could have been written anywhere in the country on the basis of information obtained solely from the internet. On a very fundamental level, the piece functions on my having plopped myself into an unfamiliar environment.</p>

<p>One nice thing about having a functioning notion of space is that it takes a boatload of pressure off your shoulders. If I’m trying to come up with an interesting bit of philosophy, for example, I’m in competition with the entire planet as more or less anyone (in theory) is capable of thinking about such problems. But interpreting dinosaur bones? You either have access to them or you don’t. Hopping on the train and booking a two-star hotel for a few nights was the bulk of the effort I had to exert. Once in the museum, I just reported what I saw.</p>

<p>Put it this way – you don’t have to be a genius to be an observer. And that is a very comforting thing.</p>

<p>Of note is that AI lacks this capacity for embodied knowledge. Indeed, the big thing that seems to prevent it from attaining true consciousness is its inability to interact with the world in real time. See “A Conversation with ChatGPT” for the sorts of games it can play with consciousness despite still not making it all the way there.</p>

<p>As a general matter, my submissions have often danced around the concept of place. See the following.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“Random Walks” discusses an interest in the immediate urban environment rather than the intellectual topics at stake in Harvard course loads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opening clause of “Ode to a Sheltered Zoomer” bemoans the fact that social media has “compactified” the world and induced a trend of rampant comparison that makes everything feel smaller than it really is.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“This Was Not Written by AI,” other handwritten posts, and the skeuomorphic redacted journal entries call attention to formatting, not just the form-independent message of a piece. Note that “Random Walks” also gets at this sort of thing with the line “the key is to stop viewing objects as referents to non-sensory thoughts.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Meetup with an Old Friend” gets at the polar opposite of this. Instead of the “visual appeal” of the text of <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> distracting me from reading the book (as it had in “Random Walks”), I put the book down early, having (in my mind) confidently located the “lumpy, Platonic mass” Dostoyevsky was pointing to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“How Does One Sort a Box of Old Photos?” synthesizes these two urges with the concept of yin and yang. That is, the embracing of place and the urge to drown oneself in detail is associated with femininity and increased activation of the hippocampus. The embracing of universality and the urge to collapse away detail via the process of generalization is associated with masculinity and reduced activation of the hippocampus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Pharmapolitics and the Vitamin D Hypothesis,” while not directly related to the present topic, brings up Vitamin D and testosterone and posits a connection between these chemicals and politics. “Journal Session with Low Vitamin D” later links low Vitamin D with a yin-like, spatially aware interpretation of a picture of a mountain range (rather than a yang-like, information-collapsing interpretation as a mere pointer to a concept).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“When Gen Z finally set its coveted gaze tapirward…” also brings up Vitamin D and testosterone. In some sense, this piece is a fictional variant of the dialogue from “Learning, Populism, and Reddit.” That is, in both pieces, the stuck-in-his-head chronic Reddit user is encouraged to take a leap of faith and just stake an arbitrary claim for once. Do note, however, that here it is <em>masculinity</em> that has been associated with an embracing of one’s place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“After Eating Some Christmas Chocolate” mainly deals with other topics, though the invocation of the Grothendieck/Erdos divide in math is an interesting one, especially given the invocation of category theory in “How Does One Sort a Box of Old Photos?” So here, Grothendieck takes up the yang side and Erdos takes up the yin side of the divide.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I should also note that <em>Moby Dick</em> comes up from time to time. It gets shoutouts in “Random Walks,” “Meetup with an Old Friend,” and “Presidents Godfather Tier List.” Moreover, “When Gen Z finally set its coveted gaze tapirward…” is rather <em>Moby Dick</em>-ish, with its playful language and its usage of an animal as a springboard for a philosophical discussion. Now, as <em>Moby Dick</em> puts a large emphasis on masculinity, whiteness, and universality, I would say it embodies the yang side of the divide I’ve been putting forward.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I have also discussed <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> in my posts (significantly more than <em>Moby Dick</em>, which gets only passing references). While roping an entire novel like that into a dichotomy with <em>Moby Dick</em> is a bit of a stretch given the large variety of characters, I am reminded of the prosecutor Kirillovitch’s description of Alyosha:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“He seems to me to have betrayed unconsciously that timid despair which leads so many in our unhappy society, who dread cynicism and its corrupting influences and mistakenly attribute all trouble to European enlightenment, to return to their ‘native soil,’ to the bosom, so to speak, of their mother earth. Like frightened children, they yearn to fall asleep on the withered bosom of their decrepit mother; to sleep there forever in order to escape the horrors that terrify them.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For those familiar with <em>Moby Dick</em>’s Chapter 23, “The Lee Shore,” Alyosha is characterized by Kirillovitch as a sort of anti-Bulkington.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> That is, he gets the yin side of the divide.</p>

<p>Now, whether there’s actually anything of merit going on here or whether I’m just forcing very, very different dichotomies to assimilate into two very, very broad camps remains to be seen. It would require someone else to say, “yeah, I think you might actually have a point.”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>But I do find this connection of “place” with the Left to be an interesting one. The whole point of identity politics, one might argue, is to preserve a notion of place and difference by splitting the population up into various boxes. People are expected to accept whatever box(es) circumstance has placed them into (always with an unconditional self-acceptance, i.e., a high self-esteem) and to try not to be anything other than “themselves.” That is to say, they are not to feel any pressure to conform to a universally desirable mode of behavior. After all, such a thing would undermine diversity, which is taken to be an <em>a priori</em> good.</p>

<p>The entire project of modern academia, meanwhile (something the Left is far more trusting of at this point), is to rise to the challenge of understanding the world via a divide-and-conquer strategy in which everyone is given a place. Variations in raw academic ability (i.e., “genius”) between those in the upper echelons are taken to be so minor the only real thing preventing someone from understanding all of human knowledge is time – “I trust you and you trust me; I’ll carve out this corner and you’ll carve out yours, and we’ll come back to one another with sufficiently lossless compressions of what we’ve found.” Gone are the days where a high-IQ chap can effectively comprehend everything in a single bound – though right-wing conspiracy theorists still like to give this a try.</p>

<p>Also, those living in the urban environments (who are far more likely to be liberal) might have a stronger notion of place because all the “hype” in the society is right there in the immediate physical environment. Conservatives from the “flyover states,” meanwhile, may be more inclined to dismiss the relevance of place as they themselves reside in regions the broader culture has deemed lesser or boring. This tendency may be especially pronounced in the modern world, where the ascendant internet simultaneously yields constant reminders of the cultural dominance of cities and provides a means of dissociating from the immediate environment.</p>

<p>So, food for thought.</p>

<p><strong>Influences Disclaimer</strong><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>: This piece was finalized under the influence of a fair degree of milk chocolate (the entire bar, bringing me up to more than 100% DV of saturated fat…), but no other source of caffeine. Sleep was roughly nine hours in a pitch-black room made that way by some damn-good new blackout curtains. I took a Vitamin D supplement with my first meal (lunch…) and went for a three-mile walk in overcast weather starting at around 4:00 PM. There was no intense exercise today. If I had to guess, I would say my testosterone was on the lower side. I haven’t seriously worked my muscles in over a week.</p>

<p>Last night and this morning, I read a decent chunk of the most recent edition of <em>The Atlantic</em>, picked up in physical form at the bookstore. Throughout this reading, I fancied myself one of the “coastal elites” the magazine is aimed at. Also, while driving around this past week, the CD playing in my car (it’s an old vehicle…) has been the Beatles album <em>Revolver</em>. Reading <em>The Atlantic</em> and listening to this album are highly unconventional for me. In fact, I kinda get the feeling I’ve been cosplaying as a stereotypical New England liberal the past few days. Blue jeans, blue shirt, blue coat, blue everything - and a sudden, strange desire to drive to Vermont.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Though I didn’t notice this until well after writing “Ode to a Sheltered Zoomer,” the gist of that piece’s opening clause bears a striking resemblance to a passage from <em>Moby Dick</em>. Like the narrator of “Ode to a Sheltered Zoomer,” Ishmael bemoans the smallness of the world, literally complaining that it is a compact manifold rather than an infinite plane. See the following passage from Chapter 52, “The Albatross”:</p>
      <blockquote>

        <p>“Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that we left behind secure, were all the time before us.</p>

        <p>“Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise in the voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims before all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.”</p>

<p>Daniel LaPointe</p>

<p>Did not take the Vitamin D supplement today or the multivitamin. Though I <em>did</em> go for a two-mile walk outside earlier, this was rather close to sunset. Given that it’s the dead of winter and given that I haven’t eaten any foods containing Vitamin D recently (to my knowledge), I’m likely pretty damn low in the stuff right now. Some observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When looking at my phone’s lock screen photo<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fn1">1</a></sup>, I immediately began to think of the depicted mountain range as a 3D object, if that makes sense. That is, I immediately intuited that the image was facing south and that the mountain on the left side of the image depicted the east-most part of the range. My brain (God I hate using that phrase, but it feels appropriate here) then superimposed over the mountains the trail that I followed when hiking them. At various points of interest along the trail – these visible in the image – I involuntarily recalled what the views were like from those points. There was something immensely satisfying about this all playing out so efficiently – in the span of less than a second. Though I’ve long had difficulty locating the right permutation of words to communicate this sensation, the <a href="https://www.stim.blog/random/">Random Walks</a> essay gets at it with: “I just want to… imagine where I am in relation to everything else.”</li>
  <li>To be clear, this doesn’t usually happen. Generally, the lock screen photo is thought of more for what is represents; rather than being a specific mountain range with an information-dense, spatially aware encoding, it is a low-information pointer to the concept of “a mountain range” and to all the cultural connotations that go with that.</li>
  <li>I am reminded of that sentence at the end of Random Walks: “The key is to stop viewing objects as referents to non-sensory thoughts.” Now, at the end of that essay I hinted at a return to the subject and an invocation of the hippocampus. As the state being described right now recalls that described in the first half of <a href="https://www.stim.blog/photos/">How Does One Sort a Box of Old Photos?</a>, and as that latter essay makes explicit reference to the hippocampus, I may finally make good on that promise.</li>
  <li>I felt an immense urge about two hours ago to look over the iPhone Calendar app and scroll all the way from my birth to today. This is a thing I will do from time to time, the idea being to free-associate memories as the months and years roll by. In a really good session of this, things I hardly ever think about are involuntarily recalled and I “learn” something about myself.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="fn2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>As a general matter, I get the feeling my ability to effectively free-associate these memories has declined over time. Tonight, however, the session went really well. Granted, I didn’t get all the way through my life (and in fact skipped around a bit; I have work tomorrow), I can state that the highly nonverbal “vibes” of the years of my life are alive and well, resting in my brain (<em>shudders</em>, there is it again…) as mountain-range-like, awe-inspiring objects that can be viewed from any one of a very large number of angles.</li>
  <li>So there we have the connection between spatial thinking and the effortless association of personal memories. Given that a part of the brain known as the hippocampus is involved in both of these activities (a fact I picked up in PSY 14 back in the Fall 2020 semester, shout-out to Liz Phelps and Dan Schacter<sup><a href="#fn33" id="fn3">3</a></sup>), I’m inclined to think something about my behavior today diverted blood flow to that region.</li>
  <li>In particular, I felt an immense <em>closeness</em> to the year 2017.<sup><a href="#fn44" id="fn4">4</a></sup> The memories started flooding in: that eight-night run through all the Harry Potter movies with my brother when on winter break after my first semester, that super cool encyclopedia of prehistoric life I got for Christmas<sup><a href="#fn55" id="fn5">5</a></sup>, those nonstop Facebook games with my high school friends<sup><a href="#fn66" id="fn6">6</a></sup>, the explosion onto the scene of r/PrequelMemes, said subreddit not only being actually funny but being so hilarious I genuinely thought I was going to laugh myself to death at one point while browsing it, the heyday of the Harvard Facebook meme page, some less than stellar things about how that semester went I won’t get into here, that time my Mom and brother came out to Boston to visit me for my birthday, etc.</li>
  <li>You know you’ve entered the mindset of a period when a song from that time just instantly starts playing in your head.<sup><a href="#fn77" id="fn7">7</a></sup> Tonight, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7iCac98TP0">the Pokémon Go Theme</a> internally blasting, followed shortly after by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSivlaSVk1k">“We Got the Power” by Gorillaz</a>. Among people who think r/place was the coolest thing ever and who say things like “The timeline split <a href="https://www.stim.blog/ode/">after that damn gorilla got shot</a><sup><a href="#fn88" id="fn8">8</a></sup>,” these two songs are very, very zeitgeisty for that period.<sup><a href="#fn99" id="fn9">9</a></sup></li>
  <li>Well, that’s free association for you. This thing is drowning in footnotes. To round this out,<sup><a href="#fn1010" id="fn10">10</a></sup> I’ll mention the last thing I had been doing prior to starting this write-up.</li>
  <li>Quite naturally, I had taken to reading the “Freshman Year Rambles.”<sup><a href="#fn1111" id="fn11">11</a></sup> These are the most interesting and character-revealing things I wrote back then – “free writes” banged out at 3:00 AM in Lamont meant to “warm up my cognitive machinery” but which in reality served as procrastination apparatuses. Ramble #15, which I’ll drop in its entirety, epitomizes the genre. Enjoy the whining.</li>
  <li>Like the author of that piece,<sup><a href="#fn1212" id="fn12">12</a></sup> I’ve got to get some sleep.</li>
</ul>

<p>Written 5/25/2022 – so about a month and a half after the bulk of my work on “Learning, Populism, and Reddit” – I was now, all of the sudden, back to liking Reddit. Here, the “last contribution to this blog” referenced is the rather mysterious “<a href="https://www.stim.blog/ode/">Ode to a Sheltered Zoomer</a>”. Like “Ode to a Sheltered Zoomer,” “The Selfish Meme” approaches ironic online culture with a striking sincerity.</p>

<div style="text-align: center; border-bottom: 3px dotted black; line-height: 0.1em; margin: 10px 0 20px;">
</div>

<p>The Selfish Meme</p>

<p><sup><a href="#fn11" id="fn1">1</a></sup> It’s been three months since my last contribution to this blog. Since then, there have been some changes in my life, most notably the death of my grandfather in mid-April. Still being in the thick of it all, I lack the perspective necessary to speak with intelligence about that event. The following words, then, can be thought of as a break from my immediate situation, and as a taste of my present mood.</p>

<p>I currently find myself disillusioned with the humanities. Any statement not backed by data or rigorous argumentation feels utterly worthless to me. No voice is more privileged than any other voice. It is the height of arrogance to hold that the individualized components of one’s writing – one’s cadence, one’s vocabulary, one’s fingerprint–like web of associations – can somehow be superior to those of another person. Whatever ego that had before allowed me to treat my intuition like settled science has now shriveled up. I no longer have the courage to generalize. I no longer have the courage to project my stray thoughts onto others. I am merely one American among some 330 million. I have a “lived experience,” and that is it.</p>

<p>It’s odd that I’ve finally come around to this idea of “lived experience,” given how long I’ve loathed the phrase. After all, there’s no <em>power</em> in speaking from my own, tiny perspective. Make sweeping generalizations, however, and I feel like a tinkerer behind the scenes. Culture is a battleground – and maybe, just maybe, an idea birthed in my head gets broader circulation in the community at large. One can of course pull this off with “data and rigorous argumentation,” but it’s so <em>enticing</em> to think that one’s intuitions can also receive this sort of success.</p>

<p>A few months back I encountered the creator of a superb image – that of the so-called “Lord Marquaad E” – in a Reddit comment section. This user, u/PuppyBaconChips, was responsible for the most iconic variant of the meme, in which a face mash of Markiplier and Lord Farquaad is photoshopped over Mark Zuckerberg’s body.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="fn2">2</a></sup> For those in the know, this image was a watershed moment in meme culture. It marked the culmination of a move toward abstraction that had long been brewing in communities like r/dankmemes and r/deepfriedmemes. What was so astonishing about the image is that no one could explain <em>why</em> it was funny, even though everyone agreed <em>that</em> it was funny. This creation, then, brought us straight into the mind of u/PuppyBaconChips. There was no diffraction by way of shared modes of expression – no erasure of his character by the regularity of things like tropes and explicable visual gags. The meme was funny in a truly elemental way, and for that reason it perfectly reproduced the mental state of its creator.</p>

<p>So, what’s u/PuppyBaconChips up to now? Not much. He’s resting on his laurels, occasionally drawing attention to his creation of the Marquaad image whenever it gets a shoutout.<sup><a href="#fn33" id="fn3">3</a></sup> I’ll note, however, that he tends not to get much notice when he shows up in a comment section. Unlike other social medias, it’s essentially impossible to acquire a following on Reddit. But no matter. If one has truly influenced the surrounding culture, seeing that people have changed their behavior as a result of your actions should be enough. There need not be love-bombing on top of it.</p>

<p>Put another way, u/PuppyBaconChips is content because an idea of his has a <em>robust memetic future</em>. As the theory goes, memes are the units of cultural reproduction. u/PuppyBaconChips can gaze upon his creation much as a parent gazes upon their child. In the same sense that the child guarantees the genetic future of the parent, the success of the u/PuppyBaconChips’ meme guarantees his own memetic future.</p>

<p>Good for him.</p>

<p>Largely composed piecemeal from January of 2022 to that April, this comes fresh off the heels of <a href="https://www.stim.blog/discourse/">“A Discourse on Atheism”</a> and deals with similar themes. The ultra-granular look at the mechanics of Christian belief bears a passing resemblance to one of Smerdyakov’s arguments from <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> – the one with Fyodor and Gregory about making a mountain crush Muslim tormenters. The polemics about Reddit, meanwhile, showcase an immense annoyance with a site that had become a major distraction and time sink.</p>

<p>Note that while everything after “And what if this check never occurs in the first place?” was written just now to finish the piece off, the general thrust of the final argument had been worked out in my head at around the time of the original composition.</p>

<div style="text-align: center; border-bottom: 3px dotted black; line-height: 0.1em; margin: 10px 0 20px;">
</div>

<p>To learn is to efface oneself before a master. It is to say, here and now, “I do not know, but I <em>can</em> know.” It is to ready oneself for a complete reshaping of the mind, in which previously inconceivable landscapes are unveiled, peak-in-Darien-like, to the learner’s amazement. Such a posturing requires no shortage of faith in one’s teacher. To lack this faith, in fact, is to abandon learning entirely.</p>

<p>There’s a reason we educate the young and not the old. Those new to the world possess a natural ignorance. They have no choice but to glean information from those around them – hence the steady stream of “Why is the sky blue?” questions which springs forth, perennially, at our nation’s playgrounds. For a good many children, this curiosity stops sometime in elementary school. For the academically inclined, however, it can continue even into adulthood. One’s educational attainment, I posit, owes largely to when one decides to exempt themselves from this mode of existence. When is enough enough? When do you say to yourself, “Alright, I’m up to snuff with the adults. It’s about time we conversed as equals”? If a child’s parents exempted themselves from this process early on – at the age of 10, say – it is only natural that the child will do the same. But what if the child exempts themselves independent of parental approval? What if something in the child’s environment precipitates this?</p>

<p>I argue that no website in the world more effectively catalyzes this exemption process than <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit.com</a>. Let’s take a look at the facts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reddit’s user-base is relatively young – mostly teenagers and young adults. Unlike the known boomer-haven Facebook, Reddit is dominated by people who can still be exempted from the traditional learning process.</li>
  <li>Reddit’s user-base takes pride in its intelligence. As Urban Dictionary puts it, Reddit is “Social media for people who think they are too good for social media.” Visit the site and there is no shortage of complaints about Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. As the Redditors see it, folks who use these apps are vapid and vain (unlike them). Hence the site’s reputation for intellectual arrogance. It is a honey pot, then, for academically inclined teenagers.</li>
  <li>The front page is littered with educational tidbits. Unlike your average piece of TikTok spam – the purpose of which is plainly to divert and amuse – these Reddit posts evince a startling sincerity. The Wikipedia addicts of r/TIL, the non-lawyers of r/LegalAdvice, the randos of r/LifeProTips and r/YouShouldKnow, the armchair psychologists of r/raisedbynarcissists, the quantum-physics-explaining-high-schoolers of r/ELI5 – all of these people genuinely think they are making the world a better place with their subpar advice. And those in the comments tend to eat it right up. The general attitude, it seems, is an unironic “we’re all in this together.” On Reddit, everyone is capable of educating everyone.</li>
  <li>Reddit is virulently anti-religion. While this does not in itself imply the users are incapable of learning (and while I myself have defended atheism on this very blog), it suggests the user-base is extremely hesitant to take leaps of faith. But faith in one’s teacher is essential to proper learning. Indeed, treat your teacher as an equal and you won’t be learning from them so much as you’ll be arguing with them.</li>
  <li>When arguments do break out, Reddit’s culturally enforced anonymity levels the playing field. As a result, we find thirteen-year-olds arguing with day traders arguing with professional historians arguing with depressed coders, etc. This is all fine and dandy, except one hardly ever knows who’s who. And when an expert does out himself, such an admission hardly conveys authority. Having myself browsed the site regularly for over five years, I can say that expertise doesn’t <em>imply</em> authority on Reddit so much as it <em>suggests</em> it. Past success, then, means nothing on Reddit. Posts and comments succeed on merit and on merit alone.</li>
  <li>Reddit has a populist culture more broadly. Recall the anti-Wall-Street sentiment driving the GameStop short squeeze, or the recent ascendency of r/antiwork. This is no surprise, given the egalitarian design of the site itself. When everybody’s a nobody, you might as well identify as a member of a collective.</li>
</ul>

<p>Putting this all together, we find that Reddit has a profound tendency to attract academically promising youth and to undermine the very traits that made them academically promising in the first place. An ability to identify and discount the opinions of intellectual inferiors is replaced with a fetishization of the common man, and with a startlingly predictable acceptance of whatever the hivemind deems correct. An ability to consume long-form content is replaced with the compulsive hoarding of trivialities – a stuffing of the brain with “fun facts” desperately awaiting an opportunity to be loosed at the dinner table. An ability to take things on faith – to let go of one’s ego, temporarily, so as to optimize learning in the long run – is replaced with a myopic insistence that everything be reduced to logos at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p>I feel a Socratic dialogue coming on. We begin with the Redditor’s rebuttal.</p>

<p>R: I take issue with your claim that Reddit’s atheism is a problem. You yourself have argued for atheism in the past. If we are in agreement on this matter, how am I the inferior one?</p>

<p>D: As stated above, the atheism itself isn’t the problem. It’s the peculiar brand of militant atheism evinced on that page. The sheer unwillingness of the users to consider that maybe, just maybe, there’s merit to these millennia-old traditions.</p>

<p>R: Pick a religion, any religion, and explain to me its merits.</p>

<p>D: That’s getting us off topic. My point is that r/atheism doesn’t have a shred of respect for these institutions, despite their immense cultural and historical significance.</p>

<p>R: The default state with religion is one of non-belief. If you cannot explain to me the merits of religion, I have no reason to take it seriously. The burden of proof is on you.</p>

<p>D: Fine, fine. I wrote an essay about this a few months ago. It’s called “A Discourse on Atheism,” and it can be found elsewhere on this blog. In the essay, I advocate atheism. But I also do my best trying to defend Christianity. I recall being rather convinced by some of the imagined Christian rebuttals.</p>

<p>R: Ok. Provide some of the Christian rebuttals.</p>

<p>D: Here’s one. This isn’t directly from the essay, but the vibe is similar. Suppose you go to work at some office job. It’s early in the morning. You’re groggy and stressed, but your boss walks by and delivers a chipper “Good morning!” How do you respond?</p>

<p>R: I would say “good morning” back to him.</p>

<p>D: As would I. Now suppose he also asks how your day is going, but your day is going terribly. How would you respond then?</p>

<p>R: In the moment, I would lie to him. My response would be something along the lines of “Good, good. How you holding up?”</p>

<p>D: As would I. But why lie to your boss? Shouldn’t one strive to be truthful in one’s interactions?</p>

<p>R: I lie because to tell the truth would be to torpedo the interaction. My boss has neither the time nor the energy for me to open up about something intimate.</p>

<p>D: If that’s the case, why did he ask you the question in the first place? Shouldn’t he have been ready for any response that could have been provided?</p>

<p>R: Not necessarily. The goal of his question wasn’t to elicit information so much as it was to gauge my mood. The speed of the response, my tone of voice, the nature of my eye contact – this is what he really wanted to know.</p>

<p>D: So there exist utterances with meanings that are entirely subtextual?</p>

<p>R: Yes, such utterances do exist.</p>

<p>D: And what if the Bible is nothing but a string of such utterances?</p>

<p>R: Look, if you want to treat the Bible as a work of literature, you can go ahead and do that. I understand metaphors as well as the next guy. But that is not the same thing as being a Christian.</p>

<p>D: How would you define a Christian?</p>

<p>R: A Christian is someone who believes that Jesus Christ died for their sins. They also believe that their holding this belief will result in them going to Heaven when they die.</p>

<p>D: Good. Now suppose someone reads the Bible as they would a work of literature. As you and I would, they dismiss literal interpretations of ridiculous claims. Nevertheless, they walk away from this reading with a conviction to attend Church every Sunday and to partake in Christian rituals. Is such a person not effectively a Christian at that point?</p>

<p>R: Such a person would only be going through the motions. In the absence of genuine belief, they would not be Christian in the truest sense of the word.</p>

<p>D: How would you define “genuine belief” in this case?</p>

<p>R: At the very least this person would have to believe in the resurrection of Christ three days after his crucifixion. This, however, plainly counts as one of the “ridiculous claims” we have assumed to be rejected.</p>

<p>D: Alright. Now suppose this person lies and responds “yes” every time they are asked whether they believe in the resurrection. On what information can we base the claim that they do not <em>truly</em> believe in the resurrection?</p>

<p>R: I’m not sure why you’re asking this. We have assumed at the outset that this person does not truly believe in the resurrection. Hence your usage of the word “lie.”</p>

<p>D: Yes, we did. But suppose we were given a group of random people and asked to sort them into those who truly believe in the resurrection and those who do not. How would we go about sorting those people?</p>

<p>R: If a practicing Christian has never stated that they do not actually believe in the resurrection, we would have no choice but to place them among the believers, regardless of their true stance on the matter.</p>

<p>D: Right. But if that’s the case, how can we be sure that the Christian religion is not full to the brim with people like this? What if the Pope, the bishops, the Protestant pastors – what if they’re all just a bunch of liars who’ve never slipped up?</p>

<p>R: Impossible. Though I disagree with the clergy’s philosophical positions, I do not in any way doubt their sincerity.</p>

<p>D: Suppose you could crack open the minds of these people. Given complete, God-like access to the thoughts of the Pope, say, how could you tell whether his belief in the resurrection is genuine? On a cognitive level, what would you be looking for?</p>

<p>R: Well, we can start with his internal monologue. If he finds himself thinking “I don’t believe what I’m saying” the moment he verbalizes belief in the resurrection, then that would suffice as proof of his non-belief.</p>

<p>D: Just to be crystal clear, you’re referring to the part of the Pope’s brain responsible for producing internalized speech, whatever it may be?</p>

<p>R: Yes, I am.</p>

<p>D: And you’re implying, in this example, that that part of the brain, in that moment, must internally voice the exact sentence “I don’t believe what I’m saying”?</p>

<p>R: Or something equivalent to that, yes. For example: “I’m lying,” “This is false,” “The resurrection never occurred.”</p>

<p>D: What if the Pope just went about his business with no internal monologue whatsoever? Could you imagine a scenario in which we would still be able to pin down nonbelief?</p>

<p>R: In theory, I suppose, the Pope could nonverbally bring to mind the idea that the resurrection did not occur. Though I’m not sure how this would be done on the cognitive level, there’s precedent of mathematicians doing this sort of thing when evaluating the truth or falsehood of propositions. That is, they make use of a visuo-spatial intuition that exists independent of language.</p>

<p>D: But would this on its own imply that the Pope does not believe in the resurrection? It is possible to bring an idea to mind – internally voiced or not – without endorsing it. Indeed, one can imagine the Pope viewing the idea “from a distance.” That is, he could recognize the idea, classify it as an impulsive thought, and separate it from the self.</p>

<p>R: Correct. And in that moment, he would be replacing the thought with an updated thought. Since the new thought clarifies that the resurrection did, in fact, occur, it would follow that the Pope is not lying.</p>

<p>D: But what about that brief moment in time when he entertained the thought that the resurrection never occurred? Are we to take that thought as representative of the Pope’s true self?</p>

<p>R: No, we are not. If the Pope recognizes this thought as impulsive and chooses to replace it with another thought, then we would say that it is not representative of his true self.</p>

<p>D: But recall that we are thinking about this on the cognitive level. If the Pope replaces the internally voiced sentence “The resurrection did not occur” with the internally voiced sentence the “The resurrection did occur,” is there anything we’d be able to detect in the brain that would distinguish these two thoughts?</p>

<p>R: Though I am no expert on such matters, I believe the latter statement would be made following increased activity in the pre-frontal cortex.</p>

<p>D: So a thought which is brought to mind is only taken to be representative of one’s true self if it survives a check from the rational part of the brain?</p>

<p>R: That is correct.</p>

<p>D: And what if this check never occurs in the first place?</p>

<p>R: What?</p>

<p>D: What if the Pope voices belief in the resurrection through sheer force of habit? What if there’s <em>nothing</em> going through his mind when he does this?</p>

<p>R: Well now we’re back to where we were before. He’s going through the motions and it’s hard to say what he actually believes.</p>

<p>D: And what’s wrong with that?</p>

<p>R: Huh?</p>

<p>D: If he’s partaking in all the Christian rituals with no contradictory thoughts in his head, then we would say that he’s a perfectly operating Christian at that point, would we not?</p>

<p>R: But he’s not independently affirming the belief.</p>

<p>D: And this is my problem with the Reddit mindset. At some point you just have to <em>shut up and put yourself out there</em>, you know? Arbitrarily stake a claim because it’s what your upbringing handed you; take up a spot in the world as a flesh-and-blood human being situated in a network of other flesh-and-blood human beings and do what your social intuition tells you is necessary.</p>

<p>R: Alright, so you’ve given up on being rational at this point.</p>

<p>D: No I haven’t. I’ve just laid down an extra axiom.</p>

<p>R: You can’t do that.</p>

<p>D: Why not?</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Daniel LaPointe]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Taken from His Own Words</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/words/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Taken from His Own Words" /><published>2024-12-26T00:00:00+07:00</published><updated>2024-12-26T00:00:00+07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Father-Joe</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/words/"><![CDATA[<p>James Song</p>

<p>Thursday, Sept 12, 2024.</p>

<p>Father Cho, a Jesuit priest, was new to the school I’m volunteering at, though not new to Cambodia—he’s been here longer than I’ve been alive. He is one of a dozen or so Jesuit priests in Cambodia. He was sent from Phnom Penh, the capital, to be one of the directors of the school here in the rural area.</p>

<p>He and I sat down one night after a dinner with the secondary school teachers. There were sixteen of them. He had met them for the first time and remembered all their names. We talked for about two hours—or at least he did, and I listened—over the last of my cigarette, about two puffs, and four of his, though he smoked only till half way or so, popping the blue mint capsules and tapping them on the box before lighting them. His words<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> are <em>italicized</em>, edited for coherence.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>

<p>The story of how Father Cho met Jesus.</p>

<p><em>Three things happened when I was in ninth grade.</em></p>

<p><em>There was a book at home that stood out to me. The title and the author I cannot forget. At that age, I thought science was the truth—we were learning about evolution and so on in school. But I read that book and the guy was talking about how science fits in with religion. I was young and didn’t get much of it, but I had some knowledge of this stuff in my head.</em></p>

<p><em>Then there was my second older brother, who was studying at Seoul National University at the time. This guy was much older and smarter than me. I respected him. He was taking Catholicism seriously and kept talking about Jesus with my mom. That got my attention.</em></p>

<p><em>And then there was a Catholic retreat I went to. In those days, boys’ schools were separate from girls’ schools, and I was curious about girls. The retreat was a day long. There was a guy named Paul, who was so nice to me. He was introducing me to all the girls, and I was excited. Then, at night, we were standing in a circle for group prayer. The leader—he was a young lay Catholic guy—got us together and said that there was one member who was sick and that we should pray for him together. That member had a bad leg that made him limp. His name was Paul.</em></p>

<p><em>At this point I prayed a prayer. I prayed many times before during Mass—I used to follow my mom there—but it was the first time in my life that I truly prayed. I prayed that Paul’s pain would be given to me instead—the selfish me that was so into meeting girls that I didn’t even notice Paul’s bad leg.</em></p>

<p><em>Then, like Elijah and the priests of Baal in the Bible<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, the Holy Spirit came down like a pillar of fire. I felt my body burning. I was shaking to the core—even now I tremble when I talk about it. I had a cool head—I could think clearly—but my whole body was hot. And I saw Jesus on the cross, bleeding. He was talking to me: “Do you see why I died? I died for your sins.”</em></p>

<p><em>Then I saw my life like a panorama, with all the moments where I sinned. I was in ninth-grade—what sin could a boy have? And I prayed two things—and this is true prayer: one, that Jesus would forgive me, that I was sorry; and two, for others, that my friend would be healed and that his sickness would come upon me in his place. He listened to the first prayer, but not the second.</em></p>

<p><em>In my mind, this went on for five minutes. When I came to myself again, the prayer circle was gone, and three or four hours had passed. From that day on, I went to Mass out of my own volition.</em></p>

<p><em>After that, like I was telling you yesterday, I proclaimed the Gospel to everyone with the passion of a Protestant—just naturally—with the fire that was in me. My friends would ask me questions about God, and the words that came out of my mouth in reply made them cry. And we went to Mass together.  A third of my ninth-grade classmates became Catholic. One is now a parish priest in Gangnam. He always jokes that I’m the reason he’s stuck as a priest. To this day he supports the Cambodia Mission.</em></p>

<p><em>But I also realized, through studying philosophy and theology at higher levels, that feeling is not everything. It’s much bigger than that. Passion alone means little.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>

<p>On Mother Theresa and the dark night of the soul, when she felt abandoned by God for the last fifty years of her life.</p>

<p><em>It is a gift from God that she was allowed to struggle with her faith. The closer we get to God, the more unbearable it will be. Look at Moses.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> We will burn and die if we see God.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>

<p>Ants and God.</p>

<p><em>Look at ants. They live in two dimensions. In order to tell ants about the human world, a human will have to become an ant and tell them about the three-dimensional human world. And do you think ants will understand? Of course not. But their world is part of the human world. God is in the fourth, fifth, sixth—the eternal dimension. We cannot understand everything.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>

<p>Christianity in Europe and Asia.</p>

<p><em>After five hundred years of Christian Europe pouring their wealth and effort on Asia, Christians in Asia made up less than three percent of the total population. We have to think deeply about why that was.</em></p>

<p><em>In Europe, what people care about is Truth. Even if institutions are corrupt, people will accept the Truth. In Asia, this is not the case. Jesus said he is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. In Europe, what compels people is Truth. In Asia, what matters is the Way. That explains the popularity of Buddhism—there is the clear eightfold-path. Muslims have clear practices—fasting in Ramadan, the five prayers a day, and so on. In Chinese philosophy, there is Confucianism and Daoism–clear directions on how to live. Christians—all we do is fight each other. We haven’t been able to show the Way.</em></p>

<p><em>There are these two sayings in Korean: 언행일치 and 언행불일치. The first one means that what you say and what you do are consistent. The second is a way of making fun of hypocrites—those that say something and do something else.</em></p>

<p><em>People around you are watching. You don’t have to say anything. They know what you believe. All we have to do is embody the spirit of Jesus.</em></p>

<p><em>But we cannot fully be like Jesus, and we have to admit this. Some are called to be martyrs. We have Jesuits in India and elsewhere being persecuted and dying for the faith. I lived in villages with Khmer people for three years when I was studying Khmer. I could do that sort of thing until my mid-thirties, but then my body wouldn’t let me continue. If I continued to eat and live the way my Khmer village friends did, maybe I would have died. Now, here in the community house, even wanting to install AC in my room—I am humble enough to admit this. All these good facilities—this is for the purpose of service. But each person is different and must discern what they are called to do.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>

<p>On Korean Protestants.</p>

<p><em>Conservative Korean Protestants are not aware of how fundamentalist and marginal they are. The Americans that brought Protestantism to Korea were fundamentalist. The danger in inter-religious dialogue is when people start to say, “I am right and you are wrong.” Fundamentalists are sure they know everything. This is very dangerous.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>

<p>On his life.</p>

<p><em>I was not supposed to be born.</em></p>

<p><em>I was very poor, so poor that one of my older sisters died as a child from malnutrition. People called my mom crazy for being pregnant with me, and even my dad was telling her to get rid of me. But Catholics believe that life is granted by God. So she kept me.</em></p>

<p><em>We were so poor we were evicted from our house when I was young. I figured the thing that caused my mom the most pain was poverty. All I wanted to do was make money for my mom. I can take care of her by making a lot of money.</em></p>

<p><em>But my mom would always whisper in my ear that I would become a priest. She had given my life up to God. I would follow her to Mass, but I didn’t really care. I even took my tithe and bought comic books! I was taught at church about hell, so in the back of my mind the idea of hell was scaring me while I read the comic books—haha! I was always uncomfortable, but that was all theory—which shows the uselessness of theory. Because the enjoyment I got from the comic books was greater than the intellectual threat of hell.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>

<p>On faith.</p>

<p><em>What is faith? Faith is belief in the miracle of loving service. It is a miracle that God provides people with love in their hearts to serve to bring about his kingdom. So I’m very thankful for you and for donors who make this school possible.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>

<p>On the Cambodia Mission.</p>

<p><em>The Jesuits needed someone who truly understood Buddhism. So I was given the mission of studying Buddhism in Sri Lanka and became an ordained Buddhist monk. Actually, most of my friends in Cambodia are monks.</em></p>

<p><em>For me, there were two motivations. There was intellectual curiosity, but that was secondary. Mainly, it was love. How can you show Cambodians that you love them? You must know them. So in Cambodia, you</em> must <em>understand Buddhism.</em></p>

<p><em>For me, two things are important about Cambodia. The raising of influential people in all areas of society who are competent—have the head—but not just that: nurturing people who also have conscience—the right heart. Second, it is good Buddhism. I have a Ph.D., but a monk’s words are a hundred times more influential in Cambodian society. If Cambodian Buddhism is solid, Cambodian society will thrive.</em></p>

<p><em>As for the Catholics, after twenty-five years of supporting 130 schools—we’ve supported Cambodia by paying salaries, training teachers, building schools—we realized that we needed to build our own school and operate it ourselves. That’s why this school was built.</em></p>

<p><em>Right now we’re stretched too thin. If I were here, I would have advocated for having only the middle and high schools. Then maybe our impact would have been greater. I would have voiced this more strongly, but I was abroad studying…</em></p>

<p><em>Nurturing leaders means teaching them English, which is why your mission is so important.</em></p>

<p><em>God plants seeds among the poor.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>

<p>On Jesus.</p>

<p><em>The question is, whatever it is we do, can we do it not out of our own enjoyment of our talent or to create a persona or a public image or for anything else like that, but in service of love for others? Jesus summed up all the laws and the prophets with two commandments<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>—love God and love others. Before he died, as a kind of will—wills are very important, we listen to the wills of dying people—he condensed the two commandments into one: as I have loved you, love others.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></em></p>

<p><em>The foundation of our faith is the love of Jesus for us. Our foundation is not dogma or creed or proclamation.</em></p>

<p><em>Ask Jesus to show you his love. He gives when you ask sincerely.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>

<p>His goodbye.</p>

<p><em>Today, I ended up ranting for a while. Good night.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>

<p>There was more that he said: an account of the moral leadership of Catholic priests during the democratic protests in the 80s in Korea; his evaluation of Protestant missionaries’ work in Cambodia; references to the Bible, including extended quotes of Matthew 25 (all five pieces of detail) in talking about Judgement Day; analyses of the Gospels, in particular of Matthew 13 and 15; explanations of various symbols, like Jesus’ washing of his disciples’ feet and the symbolism behind the miracle of the five loaves and two fish; the title and author of the book he read in ninth grade; anecdotes that showed ways that God reveals himself to us. But the essential details of the conversation are above.</p>

We laughed a lot, he more than I. All of it was said in the tone of a cool and caring senior, like that of an affectionate, experienced older brother giving relationship advice.
