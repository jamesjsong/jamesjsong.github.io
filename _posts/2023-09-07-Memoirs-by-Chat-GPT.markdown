Chat GPT 3.5[^1]

—Prompt:
Write a short memoir with the prose of Michel de Montaigne, about ten pages in length. The author should be a Harvard College dropout. He used to an English major. He is looking for meaning in life but does not find it in intellectual pursuits. So he tries other things, three months to a year at a time. He works as a line cook at a fine-dining restaurant. He nothing but play video games for three months. He works as a barista for three months. He goes to Cambodia to teach English for six months.

—Answer:
**Memoir in the Style of Michel de Montaigne: A Continuous Search for Life's Meaning**

In the heart of Massachusetts, within the echoing halls of Harvard College, I once thought to ensconce myself amidst the most illustrious minds, the promise of an English major’s life dangling before me. Yet as the days wore on, I felt as though I was a ship lost amidst a vast sea of knowledge, unable to find my port. The wisdom of the ancients, the structures of English literature, and the grand themes of human existence, though appealing, became a haunting choir, ever beckoning but never fulfilling.

Being much influenced by the discourse of the world around me, I endeavored to taste the many facets of life, considering that perhaps in simpler pursuits, more tangible and earthly, I might find that elusive meaning.

I first exchanged my book-laden bag for the hot pans and sharp knives of a line cook in a fine-dining establishment. The demands were immediate and ever-present, and I found some solace in the immediacy of my toils. Here, amidst sizzling pans and demanding chefs, the reward of labor was direct: the contented smiles of those who partook in the culinary delights I helped prepare. But while the palate was satiated, my soul still yearned.

Thus, feeling the weight of existential reflection, I chose to surrender all duty and engage in the frivolous yet absorbing realm of video games. For three months, day blended into night and night into day, as my fingers danced over the controls. In these virtual worlds, I was a hero, a villain, a builder, and a destroyer. Yet even within this escape, I recognized the illusory nature of such accomplishments. Reality continued to beckon.

Desiring a return to the tangible, I turned next to the aromatic world of coffee, serving as a barista. Amidst the steam and scent of roasted beans, I pondered upon the simplicity of human connection – the brief exchanges, the shared smiles over a cup of latte. I observed life in its many shades, as people from all walks came, paused, and left. But alas, even this stage was transient.

With a yearning for broader horizons, I embarked upon a journey to Cambodia, intent on teaching English. Here, amidst ancient temples and a culture far removed from my own, I stood before eager faces, young minds yearning to grasp a foreign tongue. In their innocence and enthusiasm, I saw mirrored reflections of my own quest. I felt close, yet so far, from that elusive understanding of life's purpose.

In these endeavors, I have tasted life's varied flavors. Through Montaigne's eyes, I realize the journey itself is perhaps the destination. As he once wrote, "We are all patchwork, and so shapeless and diverse in composition that each bit, each moment, plays its own game." My search, diverse and ever-evolving, is but a patchwork of experiences, each moment a piece of the grand mosaic of life. I know not where my path will lead next, but I walk forth, ever curious, ever questing.

And as the sun sets on the Cambodian horizon, I pen down these thoughts, understanding that life's meaning might not lie in grand revelations, but perhaps in the continuous search itself.

Can you write the same memoir, but in the voice of a snarky millenial?

—Answer:
**Memoir: From Harvard Halls to Cambodian Calls – A Millennial's "Soul-Searching"**

So, there I was, soaking up that Ivy League life at Harvard. Yeah, you heard right. The dream, right? Except, let’s be real: reading Shakespeare and analyzing motifs felt more like chasing the end of a rainbow than anything else. Turns out, “to be or not to be” wasn’t the question. The real one? "Why the heck am I even here?"

Dropping out of Harvard sounds dramatic, and trust me, the parental drama was Oscar-worthy. But honestly? I needed to find myself. Or lose myself. Or whatever profound thing you’re supposed to do in your 20s. 

First, I ditched Plato for plating – became a line cook at some fancy restaurant where people paid a ridiculous amount for tiny food. Spoiler alert: Life isn’t like Ratatouille, and I was less “chef extraordinaire” and more “I accidentally burned the crème brûlée. Again.”

Then, I decided to “reconnect with my inner child” (or just be hella lazy) and spent three months in a dark room mastering video games. Who knew saving fictional worlds wouldn’t fill the gaping void in my life? Shocking.

Alright, time to get out into the world. Coffee world, that is. Became a barista, made latte art (or tried to – most of my “hearts” looked like blobs). Learned two things: 1) People are grumpy before caffeine, and 2) Espresso couldn’t give me the existential answers I was looking for.

Getting desperate and craving some Eat, Pray, Love action, I thought, “Let’s teach English in Cambodia!” You know, find myself among ancient ruins, be that inspiring figure for kids. Realistically? I was sweating 24/7, and my students were more interested in American pop culture than proper grammar. But hey, their "Valley Girl" impressions were on point.

So, here’s the millennial truth: life isn’t an Instagram story with a pretty filter. It’s messy. It’s confusing. It’s ordering an avocado toast and then wondering if that was the reason you can’t afford a house. But, like, amidst all the chaos, the adventures, the misadventures, and the "what am I even doing" moments, I'm still hoping I might just stumble on that thing called meaning. Or at least a decent WiFi connection.

Now, write the same memoir, but give more concrete details of interesting experiences. Slightly edgy is okay. And write in the voice of a thoughtful English major, a son of a Korean-American immigrant pastor who is looking for God and feels like he almost found God.

–Answer: 
**Memoir: From the Crimson to the Khmer - Searching for God in the Everyday**

It's strange how Harvard's towering spires can sometimes feel like the shadows of old cathedrals; they both compel you to look upwards, to find something greater. Amidst Gothic architectures and illustrious classrooms, I felt like a modern pilgrim in search of an ever-elusive deity. Yet, as the son of a Korean-American immigrant pastor, I often felt the weight of God in the margins of my lecture notes and the afterglow of campus parties. My father’s sermons had shaped my world, but Harvard had thrown it into question. Still, I hoped that God, if He existed, could be found not only in sacred places but in the mundane, the gritty, and the utterly profane.

Swapping my weighty tomes on English literature for the culinary alchemy of a kitchen was more than just a career shift; it became a spiritual journey. There was this one evening – the restaurant, abuzz with the humming cadences of orders and clinking glasses, felt almost chapel-like. When a culinary critic sent back my 'Deconstructed Bibimbap' with a compliment, saying it tasted "divine", I wondered, amidst the steam and sizzle, if God was in the details.

Then, my days blurred into a haze of pixelated landscapes. Video gaming became my sanctuary. In one particular game, my character wandered a vast, open-world cathedral, its intricate designs and muted hymnals echoing my father’s church. But even as I played, I felt like a virtual ghost, haunting digital halls, my avatar's quests mirroring my own spiritual drift.

Barista life, however, was a return to earthiness. One regular – an elderly gentleman with silver hair – would order a 'Chai Latte with a shot of Espresso', which he fondly called “A Whisper of the East Meets West”. It was during our brief chats, as I handed him his peculiar concoction, that I felt closest to finding God. He once told me, his eyes crinkling with age and wisdom, "God's not just in your dad’s sermons, son. He’s in stories, in shared moments over coffee, in the love your hands pour into each cup."

Cambodia. The very air felt heavy with stories. While teaching English in a rickety classroom, overlooking fields that once bore witness to tragedies, a student shared a tale of her grandmother, who believed the spirits of ancestors whispered in the winds. One evening, as we sang a Korean hymn under a vast indigo sky strewn with stars, something stirred within me. It wasn't a lightning bolt of revelation, but a gentle inkling. Perhaps, God wasn’t something to be found, but rather felt.

Returning home, my father’s voice, rich and resonant, echoed through our church. I realized that my search for God wasn't about escaping his shadow but understanding it. In the tapestry of experiences – from the din of a restaurant to the quiet communion with a stranger over coffee – God, in all His myriad manifestations, had been there all along, waiting for me to listen.
