Daniel LaPointe

Coinage of “meanerwhile,” a clutch *Little Prince* quote, an absolute banger of an 85-word sentence – it’s hard to say why I sat on this one for so long. The primary holdup, as far as I can tell, was my concern that listing the names of the four books described in the second bullet point would cause a new line to form and make the aesthetically pleasing paragraph at the bottom of the page bleed onto the next page. Apparently, it took me over a year (the piece being originally written in September of 2023) to settle on “three field guides and a book about eastern alpine hiking.”

And let’s be real. The look of the paragraphs is absolutely relevant to one’s experience of a piece of writing. For more on this, see [the following](https://www.stim.blog/random/).
