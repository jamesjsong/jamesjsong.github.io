<p>[Author’s Note: Like “Journal Session With Low Vitamin D: In Which…”, this piece has footnotes that take some time to navigate, especially if one watches all of the linked videos. Though the reader is of course free to do as they choose, my recommendation is to: do a sweep through the main piece; then read the first six footnotes and associated sub-footnotes (i.e., the footnotes for the main piece), watching the videos as they come up; then read the “Note on Influences” in tandem with those footnotes in the usual way (i.e., reading each footnote the moment it is first encountered rather than waiting).]</p>

    <p>Having finished two summer courses last week, I’ve been given roughly three weeks of downtime until the onset of the fall semester. As I was just approved for on-campus housing, the primary anticipated stressor for this period (hunting for an apartment in Cambridge) has vanished, and I’m left with little to do.</p>

    <p>So the past few days I’ve been sifting through a Google Drive that contains documents from throughout my life. As I’m something of a hoarder in both the physical and digital sense, this drive contains things like: a scan of “My Writing Journal Book 3” from first grade; a 23-slide PowerPoint titled “Battle Strategies” made in 2009 detailing what I believed to be optimal tactics for winning a protracted fifth-grade snowball war; a 55-page-long (!) screenplay written on my spare time in eighth grade for a movie that never got made titled Night with the Pembletons; 22 scanned pages of journalling from 2014 in which it is made very clear that David Foster Wallace’s “This is Water” speech had an impact on 16-year-old me; an abandoned r/circlejerk post from 2021 in which I spoofed a “feels kinda racist” Reddit cliche that heavy metal fans are more well-behaved than rap fans, a cliche parroted all over the place in the wake of the AstroWorld crowd crush; etc..<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fn1">1</a></sup></p>
