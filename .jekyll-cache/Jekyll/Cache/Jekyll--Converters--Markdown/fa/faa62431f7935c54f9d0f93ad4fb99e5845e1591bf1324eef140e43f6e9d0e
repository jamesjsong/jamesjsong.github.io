<p><em>[Authorâ€™s Note: Like â€œJournal Session With Low Vitamin D: In Whichâ€¦â€, this piece has footnotes that take some time to navigate, especially if one watches all of the linked videos. Though the reader is of course free to do as they choose, my recommendation is to: do a sweep through the main piece; then read the first six footnotes and associated sub-footnotes (i.e., the footnotes for the main piece), watching the videos as they come up; then read the â€œNote on Influencesâ€ in tandem with those footnotes in the usual way (i.e., reading each footnote the moment it is first encountered rather than waiting).]</em></p>

    <p>Having finished two summer courses last week, Iâ€™ve been given roughly three weeks of downtime until the onset of the fall semester. As I was just approved for on-campus housing, the primary anticipated stressor for this period (hunting for an apartment in Cambridge) has vanished, and Iâ€™m left with little to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the past few days Iâ€™ve been sifting through a Google Drive that contains documents from throughout my life. As Iâ€™m something of a hoarder in both the physical and digital sense, this drive contains things like: a scan of â€œMy Writing Journal Book 3â€ from first grade; a 23-slide PowerPoint titled â€œBattle Strategiesâ€ made in 2009 detailing what I believed to be optimal tactics for winning a protracted fifth-grade snowball war; a 55-page-long (!) screenplay written on my spare time in eighth grade for a movie that never got made titled <em>Night with the Pembletons</em>; 22 scanned pages of journalling from 2014 in which it is made very clear that David Foster Wallaceâ€™s â€œThis is Waterâ€ speech had an impact on 16-year-old me; an abandoned r/circlejerk post from 2021 in which I spoofed a â€œfeels kinda racistâ€ Reddit cliche that heavy metal fans are more well-behaved than rap fans, a cliche parroted all over the place in the wake of the AstroWorld crowd crush; etc..<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fn1">1</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So thereâ€™s a lot of stuff on the Drive â€“ in fact, pretty much everything I can get on there, including old homework assignments.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="fn2">2</a></sup> The result is a panoply of self-contained universes â€“ works of art that set up and just as quickly take down internally consistent ways of knowing the world. Looking over this chaotic heap, I am reminded of Walt Whitmanâ€™s line that we â€œcontain multitudes.â€<sup><a href="#fn33" id="fn3">3</a></sup> That is, I have grown somewhat â€œpostmodernâ€ about the self in that I have little hope I will ever believe a narrative threaded through these disparate elements.</p>

And this isnâ€™t even considering the Photos and Videos folders, the latter of which contains <em>literal digitized VHS tapes</em><sup><a href="#fnaa" id="fna">a</a></sup> from forever ago.

I will add that professional VHS-to-mp4 conversions are expensive, but completely worth it. Anyone who has such tapes lying around ought to get them converted while the tech to do so is still available.

Quoting Whitman is very 10th Grade, as is usage of the phrase â€œseize the day,â€<sup><a href="#fnaa3" id="fna3">a</a></sup> which makes a sincere appearance in the aforementioned bit of 2014 journalling.

Am I the only one who still remembers <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep2_0WHogRQ">this commercial</a>? Also from 2014. Itâ€™s like there was something in the water back thenâ€¦<sup><a href="#fnii3" id="fni3">i</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fniiiiiiii3" id="fniiii3">ii</a></sup>

In past bouts of journalling (not (yet) posted here), Iâ€™ve identified this vibe as the â€œLate Obama Era Positivityâ€ (LOEP) â€“ a sort of unbridled exuberance exemplified by Ted Talks, <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AkoML0_FiV4">The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</a>, YouTube Rewind not sucking, Hamilton-mania, and the Obergefell decision.<sup><a href="#fnA3" id="fnA3">A</a></sup> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIViy7L_lo8">This video</a> in my head-cannon, marks the end of the LOEP.

Other things popping into my head that feel more tenuously connected but still kinda reek of that period include: the Daft Punk album Random Access Memories; <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8j741TUIET0">this song</a>; the Malcom Butler interception; and the Fitbit IPO and the release of the Apple Watch both being in 2015.

An alternative explanation is that overly serious, aggressively diurnal, â€œisnâ€™t existence just so <em>fucking</em> awesomeâ€-type commercials have by all means been alive and well, and that I only paid attention to this one in 2014 because we had watched <em>Dead Poets Society</em> in English class that year.
