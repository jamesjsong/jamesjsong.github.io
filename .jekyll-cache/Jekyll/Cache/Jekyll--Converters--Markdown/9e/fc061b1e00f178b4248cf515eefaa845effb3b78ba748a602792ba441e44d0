<p>Did not take the Vitamin D supplement today or the multivitamin. Though I <em>did</em> go for a two-mile walk outside earlier, this was rather close to sunset. Given that it’s the dead of winter and given that I haven’t eaten any foods containing Vitamin D recently (to my knowledge), I’m likely pretty damn low in the stuff right now. Some observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When looking at my phone’s lock screen photo<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fn1">1</a></sup>, I immediately began to think of the depicted mountain range as a 3D object, if that makes sense. That is, I immediately intuited that the image was facing south and that the mountain on the left side of the image depicted the east-most part of the range. My brain (God I hate using that phrase, but it feels appropriate here) then superimposed over the mountains the trail that I followed when hiking them. At various points of interest along the trail – these visible in the image – I involuntarily recalled what the views were like from those points. There was something immensely satisfying about this all playing out so efficiently – in the span of less than a second. Though I’ve long had difficulty locating the right permutation of words to communicate this sensation, the <a href="https://www.stim.blog/random/">Random Walks</a> essay gets at it with: “I just want to… imagine where I am in relation to everything else.”</li>
  <li>To be clear, this doesn’t usually happen. Generally, the lock screen photo is thought of more for what is represents; rather than being a specific mountain range with an information-dense, spatially aware encoding, it is a low-information pointer to the concept of “a mountain range” and to all the cultural connotations that go with that.</li>
  <li>I am reminded of that sentence at the end of Random Walks: “The key is to stop viewing objects as referents to non-sensory thoughts.” Now, at the end of that essay I hinted at a return to the subject and an invocation of the hippocampus. As the state being described right now recalls that described in the first half of [How Does One Sort a Box of Old Photos?] (link), and as that latter essay makes explicit reference to the hippocampus, I may finally make good on that promise.</li>
</ul>
