<p>Did not take the Vitamin D supplement today or the multivitamin. Though I <em>did</em> go for a two-mile walk outside earlier, this was rather close to sunset. Given that it‚Äôs the dead of winter and given that I haven‚Äôt eaten any foods containing Vitamin D recently (to my knowledge), I‚Äôm likely pretty damn low in the stuff right now. Some observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When looking at my phone‚Äôs lock screen photo<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fn1">1</a></sup>, I immediately began to think of the depicted mountain range as a 3D object, if that makes sense. That is, I immediately intuited that the image was facing south and that the mountain on the left side of the image depicted the east-most part of the range. My brain (God I hate using that phrase, but it feels appropriate here) then superimposed over the mountains the trail that I followed when hiking them. At various points of interest along the trail ‚Äì these visible in the image ‚Äì I involuntarily recalled what the views were like from those points. There was something immensely satisfying about this all playing out so efficiently ‚Äì in the span of less than a second. Though I‚Äôve long had difficulty locating the right permutation of words to communicate this sensation, the <a href="https://www.stim.blog/random/">Random Walks</a> essay gets at it with: ‚ÄúI just want to‚Ä¶ imagine where I am in relation to everything else.‚Äù</li>
  <li>To be clear, this doesn‚Äôt usually happen. Generally, the lock screen photo is thought of more for what is represents; rather than being a specific mountain range with an information-dense, spatially aware encoding, it is a low-information pointer to the concept of ‚Äúa mountain range‚Äù and to all the cultural connotations that go with that.</li>
  <li>I am reminded of that sentence at the end of Random Walks: ‚ÄúThe key is to stop viewing objects as referents to non-sensory thoughts.‚Äù Now, at the end of that essay I hinted at a return to the subject and an invocation of the hippocampus. As the state being described right now recalls that described in the first half of <a href="https://www.stim.blog/photos/">How Does One Sort a Box of Old Photos?</a>, and as that latter essay makes explicit reference to the hippocampus, I may finally make good on that promise.</li>
  <li>I felt an immense urge about two hours ago to look over the iPhone Calendar app and scroll all the way from my birth to today. This is a thing I will do from time to time, the idea being to free-associate memories as the months and years roll by. In a really good session of this, things I hardly ever think about are involuntarily recalled and I ‚Äúlearn‚Äù something about myself.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="fn2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>As a general matter, I get the feeling my ability to effectively free-associate these memories has declined over time. Tonight, however, the session went really well. Granted, I didn‚Äôt get all the way through my life (and in fact skipped around a bit; I have work tomorrow), I can state that the highly nonverbal ‚Äúvibes‚Äù of the years of my life are alive and well, resting in my brain (<em>shudders</em>, there is it again‚Ä¶) as mountain-range-like, awe-inspiring objects that can be viewed from any one of a very large number of angles.</li>
  <li>So there we have the connection between spatial thinking and the effortless association of personal memories. Given that a part of the brain known as the hippocampus is involved in both of these activities (a fact I picked up in PSY 14 back in the Fall 2020 semester, shout-out to Liz Phelps and Dan Schacter<sup><a href="#fn33" id="fn3">3</a></sup>), I‚Äôm inclined to think something about my behavior today diverted blood flow to that region.</li>
  <li>In particular, I felt an immense <em>closeness</em> to the year 2017.<sup><a href="#fn44" id="fn4">4</a></sup> The memories started flooding in: that eight-night run through all the Harry Potter movies with my brother when on winter break after my first semester, that super cool encyclopedia of prehistoric life I got for Christmas<sup><a href="#fn55" id="fn5">5</a></sup>, those nonstop Facebook games with my high school friends<sup><a href="#fn66" id="fn6">6</a></sup>, the explosion onto the scene of r/PrequelMemes, said subreddit not only being actually funny but being so hilarious I genuinely thought I was going to laugh myself to death at one point while browsing it, the heyday of the Harvard Facebook meme page, some less than stellar things about how that semester went I won‚Äôt get into here, that time my Mom and brother came out to Boston to visit me for my birthday, etc.</li>
  <li>You know you‚Äôve entered the mindset of a period when a song from that time just instantly starts playing in your head.<sup><a href="#fn77" id="fn7">7</a></sup> Tonight, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7iCac98TP0">the Pok√©mon Go Theme</a> internally blasting, followed shortly after by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSivlaSVk1k">‚ÄúWe Got the Power‚Äù by Gorillaz</a>. Among people who think r/place was the coolest thing ever and who say things like ‚ÄúThe timeline split <a href="https://www.stim.blog/ode/">after that damn gorilla got shot</a><sup><a href="#fn88" id="fn8">8</a></sup>,‚Äù these two songs are very, very zeitgeisty for that period.<sup><a href="#fn99" id="fn9">9</a></sup></li>
  <li>Well, that‚Äôs free association for you. This thing is drowning in footnotes. To round this out,<sup><a href="#fn1010" id="fn10">10</a></sup> I‚Äôll mention the last thing I had been doing prior to starting this write-up.</li>
  <li>Quite naturally, I had taken to reading the ‚ÄúFreshman Year Rambles.‚Äù<sup><a href="#fn1111" id="fn11">11</a></sup> These are the most interesting and character-revealing things I wrote back then ‚Äì ‚Äúfree writes‚Äù banged out at 3:00 AM in Lamont meant to ‚Äúwarm up my cognitive machinery‚Äù but which in reality served as procrastination apparatuses. Ramble #15, which I‚Äôll drop in its entirety, epitomizes the genre. Enjoy the whining.</li>
  <li>Like the author of that piece,<sup><a href="#fn1212" id="fn12">12</a></sup> I‚Äôve got to get some sleep.</li>

  <a href="#fn2">2.</a> Though I do recall having free-associated into existence a memory tonight that made me think ‚Äúholy crap, I haven‚Äôt thought about that in forever,‚Äù I cannot, at this moment, recall what that memory was. The little rascal seems to have gotten away, perhaps not to be fished up again for another thirty years.

  <a href="#fn4">4.</a> This closeness isn‚Äôt too much of a surprise. A few hours ago, simulating for my own amusement how a run-of-the-mill interaction with my mother‚Äôs boyfriend this evening could have played out in a more interesting and highly self-aggrandizing way,<sup><a href="#fnaa" id="fna">a</a></sup> I challenged myself to think of as many things that happened in 2017 as I could while talking to myself in the bathroom mirror.<sup><a href="#fnbb" id="fnb">b</a></sup>

<br /><br />
D: Yeah, this is one of the things I‚Äôm taking out of my room and bringing to the apartment. It comes from November 2010 ‚Äì the third and greatest of the seven Disney trips.
<br /><br />
B: Hah, you even remember the year!
<br /><br />
D: Yup. If you were to graph the quality of the Disney trips over time you would have ‚Äì [<i>visually depicts graph, egocentrically failing to account for the fact that B is facing D and that the image needs to be reversed</i>]
<br /><br />
B: Wow, Danny. You‚Äôre so smart!
<br /><br />
D: I‚Äôm an historian of the self. You say a year and I can immediately begin rattling off things that happened in that year.
<br /><br />
B: Uhhhh, how about 2017?

D: [<i>UNLOADS</i>]

This was that unspeakably beautiful scene where Alyosha kisses the ground the night of his father‚Äôs murder. The reaction I had to this scene, and a comparison of this reaction to how I took in other scenes, is perhaps worth a separate write-up.
