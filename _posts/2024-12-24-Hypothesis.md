Unlike those two “Intimations” submissions from earlier in the year [here](https://www.stim.blog/intimations/) and [here](https://www.stim.blog/authenticity/), this one actually builds to a concrete, falsifiable hypothesis. Left unsaid is the context of my job. As a call center agent working for a welfare program, I found that my implicit judgment of callers would vary with whether I had taken a Vitamin D supplement in the morning.

Note that the following scan is of a verbatim re-write of what I had initially penned on 7/16/2023; the original is littered with scribbles and is close to illegible.
