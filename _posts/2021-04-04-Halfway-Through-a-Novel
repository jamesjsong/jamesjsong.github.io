Matt Haig’s conceptually compelling *Midnight Library* suffers from less than mediocre prose. 

I picked it up on a whim because it was the top book on Goodreads. I was curious. What do people find interesting? Apparently, the story of a victim of suicide who, in an interim afterlife, gets to explore all the lives that could have been had she taken a different fork in her narrative.

Clearly, the book hit a deep chord. We have many choices and many regrets of omission. Historically, people were either members of the aristocracy or stuck in a dead-end guild, yeomanry, merchanthood, or slavery. If you were lucky, you were a figure of the dominant religion, like a priest or the temple’s resident virgin. There was no middle class to bring innovation. Though there was some talk of strengthening the middle class in Han China, for instance, social roles were basically determined before birth. Today, we are tasked with the highly unusual dilemma of being (or seeming to be) active decision-makers of our life trajectories.

But it may turn out that lives that one thinks better or ideal have their disappointments. That is what Haig depicts. While the philosopher and good daughter of the root life never went on to win gold in international swimming, the Olympian never knew the joys of Henry David Thoreau and always put herself before her ailing mother.

I want to know how the story ends. What enlightenment does she reach? What principles does she use to get herself out of the mess and how? And how does that process unfold?

But the prose is one degree away from atrocious. Even a profound composer cannot rescue a mediocre musician. I’m halfway through the novel, but forget sunk-cost bias. It seems I’ve been tempted by a sophisticated kind of click-bait. The story’s concepts were so compelling!

I should be careful to go for books with both compelling ideas and good prose. I’m putting this book down.
