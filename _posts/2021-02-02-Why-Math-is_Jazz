I hope one day to say this with the authority of an expert. In my early twenties I am just beginning to learn the fundamentals of math and jazz. Imagine a world where you actually learned something in your teens.

So, at the risk of fawning over some conceptual bridges formed by learning something new, I write and think only as a noob.

But isn’t a mathematical proof isomorphic to a jazz solo[^1]?

Take what you might call the “actions” of math. In math, there are general axioms that can be used or instantiated to come to a different point through the medium of logic. Axioms are used differently to prove different theorems, or used in the same way to prove different theorems, or used in different ways to prove the same theorem. With all their kinetic potential, axioms are lego blocks for a mathematician to play with.

Now take the “actions” of jazz. The same lick can be used in all different keys, through different chord changes, in the same way for different tunes if you are an amateur like me, or, if you’re a pro, in different ways in the same solo.

So licks are the axioms of jazz.

I claim that all activities are isomorphic to each other[^2]. Then, isn’t life just an automorphism group[^3]?

Notes:

[^1]: If G is isomorphic to H, there is a one-to-one correspondence between them. 

[^2]: One purpose of this blog is to explore the isomorphisms of all activities.

[^3]: The set of all isomorphisms (from a group to itself) is the automorphism group (of that group). This is the most (formally) profound metaphor for life I have come across.
