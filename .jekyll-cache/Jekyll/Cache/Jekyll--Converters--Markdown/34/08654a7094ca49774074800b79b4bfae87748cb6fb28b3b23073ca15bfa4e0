<p>Did not take the Vitamin D supplement today or the multivitamin. Though I <em>did</em> go for a two-mile walk outside earlier, this was rather close to sunset. Given that itâ€™s the dead of winter and given that I havenâ€™t eaten any foods containing Vitamin D recently (to my knowledge), Iâ€™m likely pretty damn low in the stuff right now. Some observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When looking at my phoneâ€™s lock screen photo<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fn1">1</a></sup>, I immediately began to think of the depicted mountain range as a 3D object, if that makes sense. That is, I immediately intuited that the image was facing south and that the mountain on the left side of the image depicted the east-most part of the range. My brain (God I hate using that phrase, but it feels appropriate here) then superimposed over the mountains the trail that I followed when hiking them. At various points of interest along the trail â€“ these visible in the image â€“ I involuntarily recalled what the views were like from those points. There was something immensely satisfying about this all playing out so efficiently â€“ in the span of less than a second. Though Iâ€™ve long had difficulty locating the right permutation of words to communicate this sensation, the [Random Walks] (link) essay gets at it with: â€œI just want toâ€¦ imagine where I am in relation to everything else.â€</li>
