I lived every moment of high school with the goal of getting into a great college.

So I said no a lot–no to friends and video games and anything else I thought trivial. Friends stopped calling. I wanted to seem better, more responsible, more cultured, more intellectual, more serious, more appealing to colleges. *I stand out because I read great books, listen to classical music, get A’s and high test scores, and write, instead of wasting time hanging out or playing video games or watching anime.* I took a morbid pride in this intellectually self-absorbed way of being.

I got the grades, put in the time with extracurriculars, and maneuvered to make myself a strong candidate in a college application. Every act was self-conscious and deliberate. *Doing* x *will make me seem* y *which will get me accepted.* I lived in constant anxiety–on top of social anxiety and depression–about achieving this goal, fueled by an all-around sense of inferiority. 

If you are curious about what it takes to go to Harvard, it's not easy. I worked hard. I slept less in high school than I did at Harvard. (I do note here that at Harvard, my rebellious streak made me go against the grain of being conscientious.) I was incredibly hard on myself. It’s a recipe for unhappiness and lack of emotional growth. I’m not sure it was worth it.

If I could go back, I would keep playing waterpolo and stick with jazz band. I quit both after two years. I would try to have a better social life. I would try wood-shop and cooking. I would get a job somewhere, a restaurant maybe. And maybe, if I could somehow suspend the conservative view on relationships that I have, a girlfriend.

I would reconsider taking AP U.S. history. I learned how to write five paragraph essays, but maybe it wasn’t worth it, no offense at all to Mr. V, who was nothing but brilliant and who never marked me tardy (though I still had Saturday school). The five on the AP Test maybe helped when the admissions officers at Harvard were considering me. But then again, I got into school just to try to get out of it every chance I got. I know; what a pain it must be to be a Harvard student! So we're on the same page.

I spent hours and hours trying to read *The American Pageant* by Stanford's David M. Kennedy. Every other sentence had an alliteration, and this made me focus on rhetorical devices and phonics more than the American pageant. His influence is still there: read my unconsciously written first sentence. On the other hand, since the AP Test came around just as we wrapped up WWII, I didn't read about Vietnam. Honors US history might have helped my current situation: I live in Cambodia now. 

The worst thing about reading was that I couldn’t really read. Reading for me has been the least effective method of learning. I wish I realized this when I was younger. Even in college, I sat in Lamont Library, whose frequenters and over-nighters are called "Lamonsters", with a Thomas Mann novel for a course with eight fat books by eight not so fat white people–Tolstoy, Eliot, Dostoevsky, etc.–with the beloved Professor of English, Philip Fisher. The Lamonster I found I was becoming sat there for three hours, Thomas Mann in hand, having read all of five pages. 

But I was always told to read books. I was never told why. I read over fifty books my junior year. I read Matthew Henry as a junior. I was sticking to this warped image of myself as a distant intellectual. 

I read a lot of Erich Fromm, the psychologist. Once, writes Fromm, a man dreamt that he was trapped in a building which was crushing him, while beautiful music was playing in the background. Fromm took this to mean the man was suffering from dedicating his life to architecture due to familial expectation instead of pursuing his passion for music. Pretty neat, I thought. 

But here's a case of why Erich Fromm might be a bad idea for a teen. On a trip across Europe, my brother and I found ourselves at the top of the Eiffel Tower just in time for sunset. The whole trip, I was expounding Erich Fromm's idea of spontaneity, drawn from Eastern philosophy, and in particular the idea that taking photos–and, by extension, videos–becomes a more important experience than the experience itself, which ought not to be. Well, my brother takes out his phone and decides to film the setting sun. His definition of "sunset" is the entire period of time from when the sun is fully above the horizon to the time it is dark to his satisfaction. I was seething with intellectual rage for the half-hour that my purist sensibilities about experience were being offended. Not even chocolate croissants and wine–consumed together, of course–could save Paris for me. And I, in turn, ruined Paris for my brother, who, in addition to being a victim of my commentary on Erich Fromm, had an aching arm.

This is partly why I dropped out of Harvard when I had ten weeks left. It is the perfect institutional symbol of so much life I missed in my teens and early twenties. Of course, I don’t need to drop out to make this point to myself. Contrary to Nietzsche's opinion, making a point to others is less important than making a point to myself. I can sleep if I let others down by moving to a new country and blocking their Instagram. I cannot sleep, period, if I let myself down.

There is a deeper reason I left, maybe a boring psychological one, which reading Alfred Adler might make clear. This is beyond my comprehension, but maybe it was God's calling.
