<p><em>The Start</em></p>

<p>â€œWhenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking peopleâ€™s hats offâ€”then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.â€  <br /> 
- Ishmael, <em>Moby Dick</em> -</p>

<p><em>Off the Beaten Path</em></p>

<p>â€œLateral knowledge is knowledge thatâ€™s from a wholly unexpected direction, from a direction thatâ€™s not even understood as a direction until the knowledge forces itself upon one. Lateral truths point to the falseness of axioms and postulates underlying oneâ€™s existing system of getting at truth.â€  <br />

<p><em>Adventures</em></p>

<p>â€œI love brief habits and consider them an inestimable means for getting to know many things and states, down to the bottom of their sweetness and bitternesses; my nature is designed entirely for brief habits, even in the needs of my physical health and altogether as far as I can see at allâ€” from the lowest to the highest. I always believe that here is something that will give me lasting satisfactionâ€”brief habits, too, have this faith of passion, this faith in eternityâ€”and that I am to be envied for having found and recognized it; and now it nourishes me at noon and in the evening and spreads a deep contentment all around itself and deep into me so that I desire nothing else, without having any need for comparisons, contempt or hatred. But one day its time is up; the good things part from me, not as something that has come to nauseate me but peacefully and sated with me as I am with itâ€”as if we had reason to be grateful to each other as we shook hands to say farewell. Even then something new is waiting at the door, along with my faithâ€”this indestructible fool and sage!â€”that this new discovery will be just right, and that this will be the last time. That is what happens to me with dishes, ideas, human beings, cities, poems, music, doctrines, ways of arranging the day, and life styles.â€  <br /> 
- Frederich Nietzsche, <em>The Gay Science</em> -</p>

<p><em>The School of Life</em></p>

<p>â€œI realize increasingly that I am only interested in learnings which significantly influence behaviorâ€¦ I have come to feel that the only learning which significantly influences behavior is self-discovered, self-appropriated learningâ€¦ Such self-discovered learning, truth that has been personally appropriated and assimilated in experience, cannot be directly communicated to another.â€  <br /> 
- Carl Rogers, <em>On Becoming Human</em> -</p>
