<p>Hey folks. James and Sam roped me into this. Iâ€™m a junior at Harvard College with a concentration in mathematics and a secondary in psychology. Despite this path of study, Iâ€™ve always been a humanities sympathizer, hence the blog posts. In my spare time I enjoy hiking, playing piano, and talking politics with my high school friends. Fun facts? I donâ€™t know. I sold my GME shares at $420.69, I guess.</p>

<p>Topics I may write about in the future include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Rise and Fall of Harvard Memes for Elitist 1% Tweens</li>
  <li>Harvard Confessions and the STEM/Humanities Debate</li>
  <li>The Cult of Pure Math at Harvard</li>
  <li>Harambe and the Folk Religion of r/dankmemes</li>
  <li>00â€™s Nostalgia</li>
  <li>r/LiminalSpace and Caretakerâ€™s EATEOT</li>
  <li>Does Gen Z Have a Culture?</li>
</ul>

<p>I was born on a humid day in August of 1997 in a world still transforming from analog to digital, back when there were still payphones, but nobody used them. I have tried my best to be a good person, but I have fallen short many times and been too lenient with my failings. I enjoy writing about religion, philosophy, poetry, and movies, but my dayjob is as a strategy consultant. I have a B.A. in Classics from Harvard and I enjoy reading Latin, Ancient Greek, (Old, Middle, Modern) English, (Old, Modern) French, (Middle, Modern) Welsh, Old Irish, Old Occitan, Old Norse, Italian, and Iâ€™m trying to learn Biblical Hebrew, Avestan, and Sanskrit.</p>

<p>Finally. I graduated. This is an experimental blog, which I started as a result of the pandemic. Letâ€™s do it.</p>
