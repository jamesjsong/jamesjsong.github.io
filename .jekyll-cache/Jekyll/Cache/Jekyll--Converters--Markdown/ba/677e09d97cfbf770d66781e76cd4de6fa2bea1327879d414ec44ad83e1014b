<p><em>[Authorâ€™s Note: Like â€œJournal Session With Low Vitamin D: In Whichâ€¦â€, this piece has footnotes that take some time to navigate, especially if one watches all of the linked videos. Though the reader is of course free to do as they choose, my recommendation is to: do a sweep through the main piece; then read the first six footnotes and associated sub-footnotes (i.e., the footnotes for the main piece), watching the videos as they come up; then read the â€œNote on Influencesâ€ in tandem with those footnotes in the usual way (i.e., reading each footnote the moment it is first encountered rather than waiting).]</em></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having finished two summer courses last week, Iâ€™ve been given roughly three weeks of downtime until the onset of the fall semester. As I was just approved for on-campus housing, the primary anticipated stressor for this period (hunting for an apartment in Cambridge) has vanished, and Iâ€™m left with little to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the past few days Iâ€™ve been sifting through a Google Drive that contains documents from throughout my life. As Iâ€™m something of a hoarder in both the physical and digital sense, this drive contains things like: a scan of â€œMy Writing Journal Book 3â€ from first grade; a 23-slide PowerPoint titled â€œBattle Strategiesâ€ made in 2009 detailing what I believed to be optimal tactics for winning a protracted fifth-grade snowball war; a 55-page-long (!) screenplay written on my spare time in eighth grade for a movie that never got made titled <em>Night with the Pembletons</em>; 22 scanned pages of journalling from 2014 in which it is made very clear that David Foster Wallaceâ€™s â€œThis is Waterâ€ speech had an impact on 16-year-old me; an abandoned r/circlejerk post from 2021 in which I spoofed a â€œfeels kinda racistâ€ Reddit cliche that heavy metal fans are more well-behaved than rap fans, a cliche parroted all over the place in the wake of the AstroWorld crowd crush; etc..<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fn1">1</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So thereâ€™s a lot of stuff on the Drive â€“ in fact, pretty much everything I can get on there, including old homework assignments.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="fn2">2</a></sup> The result is a panoply of self-contained universes â€“ works of art that set up and just as quickly take down internally consistent ways of knowing the world. Looking over this chaotic heap, I am reminded of Walt Whitmanâ€™s line that we â€œcontain multitudes.â€<sup><a href="#fn33" id="fn3">3</a></sup> That is, I have grown somewhat â€œpostmodernâ€ about the self in that I have little hope I will ever believe a narrative threaded through these disparate elements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, are there at least some life narratives I find myself falling back on? Sure. A classic one is â€œthe birth of the cognitively modern self,â€ in which the grandiose mysticism of 2012 gives way to a grounded Enlightenment rationalism in the spring of 2013, the dividing line being my decision to eat KFC instead of pizza on Good Friday when at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museumâ€™s food court.<sup><a href="#fn44" id="fn4">4</a></sup> Another narrative treats a trip to Disney World as â€œthe swan song of childhoodâ€ â€“ the onset of puberty, the passing of my grandmother, and my first taking the SAT (in seventh gradeâ€¦<sup><a href="#fn55" id="fn5">5</a></sup>) happening in fairly rapid succession after that. Then youâ€™ve got a more recent narrative that 2022 was a â€œnuclear winterâ€ following a mess at Harvard â€“ a dismal period that saw a true embracing of personal responsibility on the tail-end, and a newfound suspicion of the field of psychology as a whole.<sup><a href="#fn66" id="fn6">6</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But Iâ€™m starting to become tired of narratives like this. Instead of solipsistic coming-of-age stories, what I really want are stories focused on others. I want something with <em>depth</em> to it, you know? Perhaps this is what marriage and children provide â€“ a flesh-and-blood grounding in the world and an inherent stakes to everything that renders all that comes before mere shadows upon the wall of the cave.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This isnâ€™t the first time Iâ€™ve come to associate document sorting with the thought of children. In fact, I reckon my future children (should they ever come to exist) are the intended beneficiaries of this act of sorting. How surreal would it be to know, as a child, exactly what your parents were up to when they were your age â€“ to be able to quickly determine what they looked like and what they sounded like and what they thought at the drop of a hat? Though it may sound a smidgen obsessive for a parent to construct such an archive â€“ and though a good many children wouldnâ€™t find such an archive to be particularly interesting â€“ it wouldnâ€™t surprise me if this sort of thing starts to become more common with time. That is, we are reaching a point where the Hyper-Documented are starting to have kids with one another. The result, assuming the records have been meticulously enough maintained, will be sort of like one of those race-against-your-ghost things in Mario Kart. â€œHold on. 13 years and 8 monthsâ€¦ did Dad have a deeper voice by this point?â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So maybe I donâ€™t need to worry about overarching narratives. Just working out the chronology and getting everything on the Drive<sup><a href="#fn77" id="fn7">7</a></sup> should be good enough.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the audience pick out the patterns.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note on Influences: In a prior entry, I called this section the â€œInfluences Disclaimer,â€ as if to distance myself from what I had written. But that is not the goal here. Iâ€™m just genuinely interested in if thereâ€™s some sort of connection between diet, sleep, and whatnot and the sort of written work I produce.<sup><a href="#fn88" id="fn8">8</a></sup> Here we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Excellent sleep the night before writing the above, 8 hours and 40 minutes per the records (yes, I do sleep tracking, and I have for quite a while nowâ€¦), this following a string of three nights averaging 8 hours and 35 minutes. So very good sleep on the whole (not a surprise, with the lack of obligations this week).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sleep went from roughly 4:00 AM to roughly 12:40 PM, consistent with a night owl pattern of mine. Very good blackout curtains (complete with a scheme involving duct-taping the curtains to the wall to block ALL light) make this possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lunch was a turkey and cheese sandwich with lettuce. Pretzels on the side with chocolate oat milk to drink. Eaten shortly after waking. Took a menâ€™s gummy multivitamin with this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exercise included a 3-mile walk in the local Pine Bush Preserve starting at around 6:30 PM in overcast weather. Stopped for a half-hour-long chat on the phone with my father partway through the walk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some degree of pre-occupation with my cousinâ€™s website. The guy is four years older than me, I havenâ€™t interacted with him too much in my life, and I just now learn heâ€™s got: an album on Apple Music, several publications in left-wing media outlets, and an appearance on Sam Sederâ€™s podcast. I listened to his album in a bit of a â€œholy shitâ€ moment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dinner was salmon with asparagus and microwaved Uncle Benâ€™s long grain and wild rice. Regular milk (Lactaid brand for my stomach) to drink. Composition of the above (and below?) last night was punctuated by asparagus-smelling piss breaks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snacked on Pepperidge Farm Pirouettes<sup><a href="#fn99" id="fn9">9</a></sup> throughout the day, a source of sugar and a likely source of small amounts of caffeine via the chocolate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Got some feedback from a friend of mine about some video game-style music I had written/performed and shared with him.<sup><a href="#fn1010" id="fn10">10</a></sup></p>

<p>Notes</p>

<!-- this is for first level: 1, 2 -->

This oneâ€™s short enough and of general enough interest to drop here. <a href="/assets/dan_circle.pdf">Enjoy</a>.

And this isnâ€™t even considering the Photos and Videos folders, the latter of which contains <em>literal digitized VHS tapes</em><sup><a href="#fnaa" id="fna">a</a></sup> from forever ago.

<div id="fnaa" style="margin-left: 20px;">

I will add that professional VHS-to-mp4 conversions are expensive, but completely worth it. Anyone who has such tapes lying around ought to get them converted while the tech to do so is still available.

Quoting Whitman is very 10th Grade, as is usage of the phrase â€œseize the day,â€<sup><a href="#fnaa3" id="fna3">a</a></sup> which makes a sincere appearance in the aforementioned bit of 2014 journalling.

In past bouts of journalling (not (yet) posted here), Iâ€™ve identified this vibe as the â€œLate Obama Era Positivityâ€ (LOEP) â€“ a sort of unbridled exuberance exemplified by Ted Talks, <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AkoML0_FiV4">The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</a>, YouTube Rewind not sucking, Hamilton-mania, and the Obergefell decision.<sup><a href="#fnA3" id="fnA3">A</a></sup> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIViy7L_lo8">This video</a> in my head-cannon, marks the end of the LOEP.

Other things popping into my head that feel more tenuously connected but still kinda reek of that period include: the Daft Punk album Random Access Memories; <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8j741TUIET0">this song</a>; the Malcom Butler interception; and the Fitbit IPO and the release of the Apple Watch both being in 2015.

An alternative explanation is that overly serious, aggressively diurnal, â€œisnâ€™t existence just so <em>fucking</em> awesomeâ€-type commercials have by all means been alive and well, and that I only paid attention to this one in 2014 because we had watched <em>Dead Poets Society</em> in English class that year.

For those not in the know, â€œdonâ€™t eat meat on Good Fridayâ€ is a Catholic thing. So opting for the KFC instead of the cheese pizza â€“ in a building that serves as a testament to mankindâ€™s ingenuity and his literal foray into the heavens, no less â€“ amounted to a rejection of God.
    <br /><br />

<div id="fn55">

I donâ€™t mean to brag. I just want to note that pushing a kid academically at an age like that can quickly induce adult levels of work obsession.

â€œThe field of psychology rests on the assumption that human beings can be effectively modeled as deterministic systems. This assumption is fundamentally unbecoming of human dignity, and the entire discipline is to be held at armâ€™s length because of this.â€

Scans of independent mathematical investigations starting in 10th grade feel like a priority. Those are still just an enormous heap of papers.
