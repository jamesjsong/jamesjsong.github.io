<p>Coinage of â€œmeanerwhile,â€ a clutch <em>Little Prince</em> quote, an absolute banger of an 85-word sentence â€“ itâ€™s hard to say why I sat on this one for so long. The primary holdup, as far as I can tell, was my concern that listing the names of the four books described in the second bullet point would cause a new line to form and make the aesthetically pleasing paragraph at the bottom of the page bleed onto the next page. Apparently, it took me over a year (the piece being originally written in September of 2023) to settle on â€œthree field guides and a book about eastern alpine hiking.â€</p>

<p>And letâ€™s be real. The look of the paragraphs is absolutely relevant to oneâ€™s experience of a piece of writing. For more on this, see <a href="https://www.stim.blog/random/">the following</a>.</p>
