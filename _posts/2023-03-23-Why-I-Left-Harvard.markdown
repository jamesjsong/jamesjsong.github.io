If you are curious about what it takes to go to Harvard, it's not easy. I worked hard. I slept less in high school than I did at Harvard. I was incredibly hard on myself. It’s a recipe for unhappiness and lack of emotional growth. I got in because I breathed every breath in high school with the goal of getting into a great college. I’m not sure it was worth it.

If I could go back, I would keep playing waterpolo and stick with jazz band. I quit both after two years. I would try to have a better social life. I would try wood-shop and cooking. I would get a job somewhere, a restaurant maybe. And maybe, if I could somehow suspend the conservative view on relationships that I have, a girlfriend.

I would reconsider taking AP U.S. history. I learned how to write five paragraph essays, but maybe it wasn’t worth it, no offense at all to Mr. V, who was nothing but brilliant and who never marked me tardy (though I still had Saturday school). The five on the AP Test maybe helped when the admissions officers at Harvard were considering me. But then again, I got into school just to try to get out of it every chance I got. I know; what a pain it must be to be a Harvard student! So we understand each other.

I spent hours and hours trying to read *The American Pageant* by Stanford's David M. Kennedy. Every other sentence had an alliteration, and this made me focus on rhetorical devices and phonics more than the American pageant. So on the one hand, my prose improved. On the other hand, since the AP Test came around just as we wrapped up WWII, I didn't read about Vietnam. Honors US history might have helped my current situation: I live in Cambodia now. 

The worst thing about reading was that I couldn’t really read. Reading for me has been the least effective method of learning. I wish I realized this when I was younger. Even in college, I sat in Lamont Library, whose frequenters and over-nighters are called "Lamonsters", with a Thomas Mann novel for a course with eight fat books by eight not so fat white people–Tolstoy, Eliot, Dostoevsky, etc.–with the beloved Professor of English, Philip Fisher. The Lamonster I found I was fast becoming sat there for three hours, Thomas Mann in hand, having read all of five pages. 

But I was always told to read books. I was never told why. I read over fifty books my junior year. I read a lot of Erich Fromm, the psychologist. Once, writes Fromm, a man dreamt that he was trapped in a building which was crushing him, while beautiful music was playing in the background. Fromm took this to mean the man was suffering from dedicating his life to architecture due to familial expectation instead of pursuing his passion for music. Pretty neat, I thought. 

But here's a case of why Erich Fromm might be a bad idea for a teen. On a trip across Europe, my brother and I found ourselves at the top of the Eiffel Tower just in time for sunset. The whole trip, I was expounding Erich Fromm's idea of spontaneity, drawn from Eastern philosophy, and in particular the idea that taking photos–and, by extension, videos–becomes a more important experience than the experience itself, which ought not to be. Well, my brother takes out his phone and decides to film the setting sun. His definition of "sunset" is the entire period of time from when the sun is fully above the horizon to the time it is dark to his satisfaction. I was seething with intellectual rage for the half-hour that my purist sensibilities about experience were being offended. Not even chocolate croissants and wine–consumed together, of course–could save Paris for me. And I, in turn, ruined Paris for my brother, who, in addition to being a victim of my commentary on Erich Fromm, had an aching arm.

This is partly why I dropped out of Harvard when I had ten weeks left. It is the perfect institutional symbol of so much life I missed in my teens and early twenties. Whatever else it was, the character I became through the journey to Harvard has thrust me, once I reached the destination, out of it. I sprinted for years, head down for maximum speed, and fell from the momentum before the finish line. At a pause from the ground, it seems like the finish line up ahead is somehow empty.

Is it that achievement itself is the issue? Why do we stretch ourselves so unreasonably, in the name of wealth or greatness? It is the modern hero's myth. And we have our productive heroes. 

We might rise to the occasion when the situation calls for it. Socrates gracefully and Jesus magnificently did that in their crucial moments. But I don't recall their being overworked from self-imposed, career-driven momentum. That poise is greatness I admire. 

That spirit of poise, of flowing like water, is absent at Harvard. The first day I was with Harvard students–the meetup for high school seniors in Southern California that got accepted into Harvard–I felt something weighing me down. Something wasn't right. It took me a study abroad, a trip across Europe, a deep dive into *The Brothers Karamazov,* a pandemic, a startup internship, a stint as a research assistant, a year cooking French-Italian food, some months as a barista, changing majors two times, three gap years, struggle with my faith throughout and the move to Cambodia–it took me six years to figure out what that weight was that April afternoon I shook hands with my future classmates.

Christians have a neat aphorism for poise, in Proverbs 3:5. *Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not in your own understanding.*
